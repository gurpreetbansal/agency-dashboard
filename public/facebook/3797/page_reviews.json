Recently I applied for Essential Work visa and sent them all the documents in advance as requested, all they had to do is to submit them to the Immigration..\nOne month later I was following up because my visa was expiring, then ICL asked me to provide the police reference check (I sent them a month ago).\nThey missed the email from the Immigration asking for my police reference document they forgot to submit and didn\u2019t get back to me at all, until my visa has expired! \nThey explained it as \u201cwe got confused\u201d and didn\u2019t get back to me until later I was following up myself.\nI have closed my account with them (with no refund provided).\nAlso misleading information regarding my residency application and really poor communication in general.\nShocking experience!
