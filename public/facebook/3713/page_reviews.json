Sends spam through gmail and other free mail accounts to hide identity then identifies themselves when you respond positively to them. Never ever employ their services unless you like supporting Indian based scammers that operate illegally.","rating":0,"date":"20180716","reviewer":"David Forester"},"20161123":{"recommendation":"positive","review_text":"Awesome organization, environment, staff :)\n\nI love working here and will recommend everyone to join our organization for   different experience......","rating":5,"date":"20161123","reviewer":"Shivani Vinay Jain"},"20160226":{"recommendation":"negative","review_text":"Why on earth would anybody use a company who has to feel the need to spam people for sales? \n\nPoor shoddy marketing.
