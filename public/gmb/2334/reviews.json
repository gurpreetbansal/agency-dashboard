I have an autoimmune disease that can make it hard for me to do much of anything. A couple of years ago I started to use their fluff and fold service regularly. It was fairly priced and my laundry was done well. I stopped using their service a few months ago because my clothes come back with half of them inside out, some of it not fully dried, most of a full bottle of detergent is used.

Decided to venture out and was pleasantly surprised by the neatness of the place and the quality of the machines.  The lady attendant was very helpful as I haven't been to a coin operated machine in decades.  The machines operated flawlessly and quickly.  It only took about 30 minutes per machine to wash the duvets.  Drying was about 20 minutes.  Would have taken much much longer even if I could do them at home.  The ability to use a credit or debit card to operate the machines made the experience even better.\n\nWould have been a 5-star but the men's toilet was not working when I visited.\n\nOverall very satisfied.","rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"It can be tough to wash large curtains and duvets, but there's nothing our machines can't handle!
