There was classic music in the background, aromatherapy scent, comfy sofa,\nplenty of dog toys around and things for them to explore! I was amazed how Camacho, who usually gets nervous in a new environment and barks at stranger, was so happy and relaxed throughout the assessment. We just couldn't believe it!\n\nAntonella\u2019s knowledge is impressive and her way of explaining everything in such a clear way made it so easy for us to follow her advice.\n\nThe whole experience was just so enjoyable and professional! Thank you Simon and Antonella!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thanks Julian for such a lovely review!

Antonella is a brilliant, caring, very skilled trainer and behaviourist! Simon has been brilliant with comms and support during our puppy class! I have my cockapoo puppy enrolled in her puppy classes which have been so great for my little Milo! We are also working on the dynamic between my 18 month old Dog and the new puppy and I am learning so much! Antonella has a wealth of knowledge and just simply knows her stuff! After our assessment I was able to go home and apply some of what we had discussed pre starting the behaviour training sessions- just from this, there has been a massive improvement in 24h. i have also sent her a friend who is also very happy with how well her training has been going with her reactive maltipoo. The center is also beautiful and so clean! It is full of engaging areas. Just brilliant. thank you for all your help with us!! We always look forward to our sessions with  you!!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so much Cece for such a lovely review!

Antonella is pictured here training my dog with recall in Battersea Park.\n\nSir Michael is now 7, and Antonella in her wonderful new premises is teaching him to leave me alone when we dine (I used to feed him scraps and cannot break this learned-behaviour without help!).

Antonella was recommended by Amwell Vet Practice and quite plainly knows her stuff. She  managed to ease us into the journey of owning our little doggy , whilst avoiding or digging us out of some of the pitfalls. The centre is spacious and allowed our puppy some freedom to explore and gain confidence safely. Her knowledge with a common sense approach  gave us the  ability to put it into practice.
