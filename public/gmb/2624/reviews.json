They were very quick to get out on sight to perform and inspection and provide bids.  Below are a few highlights.\n\n- In addition to being very efficient and fast\u2026. they use a tarping system that catches the debris falling from the roof to protect your landscaping and expedite clean up. Very thoughtful and non- typical for a contractor.\n\n- They are also very up to date with technology used. Pre- bid Cody used google earth to inspect the roof size\/shape\/estimated age, etc., which sped the inspection process up. They also have a web-app that provided minute by minute picture updates of the project while it was under way. This was great for me, since I was traveling while they were performing the work.\n\nAl in all- great experience and would highly recommend.\n\nSee attached drone pictures Cody shared of the project at completion.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Reece, thanks for trusting us with your roof replacement!

I read the reviews and choose Integris Roofing, because this company received the best reviews. Cody and his Team were AWESOME from start to finish!!! Cody came to do a roof inspection the first day I called and came back the next day to tarp the roof. Cody took pictures and explained where the leak occurred, why the leak occurred, and what had to be repaired\/replaced. Cody worked with me and the insurance company to ensure that we had all the information to start and complete the claims process.  I received updates from Cody during the entire installation and repair process.  I knew what day\/time the crew was coming and who was coming.  Cody came by periodically during the roof installation to inspect the crews work and progress.  Once the job was complete, Cody came back for a final inspection.  He did the same for the bathroom repairs; came by to check on the progress and came back for a final inspection.  In addition, I asked Cody to replace the soffits and fascia boards across the back of my house.  The quote    was very reasonable and the workers did a GREAT job!!!!

I waited to get one or two more estimates just to compare, but no other companies replied back. I did check on the the past jobs that Integris had completed and was confident that they would do a great job for my home. They did some impeccable work. They take pride in their craft as well as job completion. My wife and I are more than satisfied with the job that Integris Roofing did on our home. I would recommend this company to anyone needing roofing work done on their home.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Albert, we thank you for choosing as your Houston roofing contractor.","reply_update_time":"2021-03-29T23:40:49.426Z"},{"create_time":"2020-11-19T23:22:23.273Z","update_time":"2020-11-19T23:22:23.273Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnxklehQsiF2pe06-JEUdYz-8C7UxWqV5jTrn0T6VMpct15K3LRSsQTWh5cETv8tVFVvXkU6w","reviewer_display_name":"Malcom Brant","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gi9LPq81zzleXahpH_8GhGNmNSUkGxEH4A0tA-zog=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"They came out very fast and I got my roof on before the others could even come out for an estimate!

I even referred my brother to Integris as well after hurricane Delta did a number to both of our roofs. The workers were great, they cleaned up the yard after they were finished and didn\u2019t leave anything behind. Cody & Kurt came by to have us sign a contract for the roof a few days prior and visited with us like they were family. My roof is exceptionally beautiful and I am VERY happy with the results.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for the kind words Dale!
