Every single person I have dealt with at Transou has been fantastic. However, special shout-out to Andrew (service tech) and Megan in customer service. Megan has been friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. She worked hard to coordinate multiple teams since we needed risers installed and the system to be pumped. I just bought a new home, and never have owned one with a septic system before so this is all new to me. Andrew while he was out here pumping the tank went out of his way to educate me on ins and outs of the system and how it operates, upkeep recommendations and things to look out for since the system wasn't mainted properly before I purchased the home.

In other words we do not charge an hourly labor rate, as we feel that could fluctuate too much and give an unfair disadvantage for the customer. In other words, many trade individuals are time plus material. They will give a quote of what they think it will take, but if someone who is not as experienced prices the same job it could take them much longer, thus making the same job cost twice as much for the customer. We pride ourselves in giving upfront pricing for our customers that doesn't change by end of the job. If you have any questions about the service you received we'd be happy to discuss further. You can reach us by calling the office and asking to speak with our Plumbing GM.","reply_update_time":"2021-09-10T22:02:45.972Z"},{"create_time":"2021-08-10T17:52:47.271Z","update_time":"2021-08-10T17:52:47.271Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlSos_51gi6PaqJvfWExqiJDzQ9OaNwSIAKY3QQBIkUDg6HQikvkmYpqnZGF50YlPmc5hKnsQ","reviewer_display_name":"Daniel Chipman","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gj3GoxaMhmw6cyC9aRxIppm3mcqP8ewaJfMY3JF=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"We bought a house sight unseen from the far side of the Rocky Mountains and when we got here, we found our home came with a bunch of problems!
