We were in a quagmire of (mis)information as we were starting a search for assisted living for our mother.  Paul took considerable time listening to our needs and concerns.  He is very caring, and empathetic.  Paul is extremely prompt with communication.  He had suggestions of facilities for us to consider within days.  Paul's research found a home for our mother that is spot on!    We moved her into the facility 2 weeks ago.  While not an easy journey, or transition for any family, Paul paved the way smoothly for us.  I absolutely recommend Paul and The Care Concierge of New England.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you!","reply_update_time":"2021-04-01T00:53:18.900Z"},{"create_time":"2020-12-28T17:49:56.274Z","update_time":"2020-12-28T17:49:56.274Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnT1_3mV41eP2SqXCXMn4G4sM-oWQodWVDfxSatCNGifzU2IP7D-aHzxUgBgsPIjNoTNcUG_Q","reviewer_display_name":"Jeff Mello","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJwUThyEBSbIcgeMVeahPIgN4nTmABXbwDAbYZuI=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I can't say enough about how incredible Paul is and how valuable his services are.   I first contacted him when I was investigating assisted living options for my mother.  He came to my house to meet, took copious notes regarding her health and lifestyle\/preferences, and quickly got back to me with three different options, customized to our needs with explanations as to how and why he chose them.\n\nSadly, less than a year later my mom needed to move to a nursing home as her health was deteriorating rapidly.  Even though Paul focuses on assisted living rather than nursing home placement, he came to the rescue again and gave me a referral to a nursing home which wasn't on our proverbial radar screen yet provided a perfect fit.\n\nTransition in living arrangements and care for the elderly are incredibly stressful for both the patient and the family.  There are myriad factors to consider and the wide availability of options for care can be complex and confusing, adding to the emotional toll associated with the need for additional care.   Paul knows elder care and elder care options in Rhode Island like no one else and, perhaps more important, is an empathetic listener who truly care about the families he assists.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-11-13T14:33:38.485Z","update_time":"2019-11-13T14:33:38.485Z","review_id":"AbFvOql_FkqjM84MyvNELb8PeXhAxKIcT9Nc5iD4wCX2PNEEnLslt2Au0LKmgQJCmnhP9qKqfXDNmg","reviewer_display_name":"Mark Mulligan","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJyViLeg8q6w7Pz6_Yu1qZxcP-iLtHG2xd4KsGZn=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Paul was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
