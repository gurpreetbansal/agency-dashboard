Our needs were very specific, hence, our inability to find a solution off the shelf. We interviewed several companies and ended up deciding on Fahrenheit for a few reasons. First, the fact that they picked up their phones. That may seem like a no-brainer but let me tell you\u2026many of these shops are simply not reliable. Another point that drove us to FM was their understanding of our needs. We explained once and they expanded on it as if the thing was their own idea\u2026they offered a lot of insight and we enjoyed getting their perspective on an otherwise very complex application. The project lasted several months and they kept their head down until it was finished.

Their digital strategy team, albeit small (4 people) at the time of our encounter, was incredibly well versed in digital strategy and their insights were very valuable and instrumental in our decision making process. If you engage with them in digital marketing, you\u2019ll receive these video updates where they walk you through the progress of your campaign and I have to say, it is to me much more insightful than a hundred pages with charts and meaningless abstracts. I also like the fact that their agreements are month to month. Puts them on a position to have to perform in order to secure my business.

The visual appeal and easy navigation are the most obvious aspects but I was most impressed when we asked them to give us the ability to edit items on the website ourselves vs going through them for adjustments.   I expected to have a fairly limited administering role on the contents but was amazed, happy and surprised to find the incredible level of access and abilities that we were given.  Not only that, but the incredible team at Fahrenheit were more than happy to take the time to give us thorough training on administering the website.  It was not complicated at all and Fahrenheit deserves roaring applause for the intuitive nature and well laid out editing process for our website.\n\nI could not be happier with our decision to go with Fahrenheit Marketing and would highly recommend them to you if you are tired of a cluttered, boring website.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"When we designed the Texas Healthcare Association website, we had no idea we'd make so many friends along the way.
