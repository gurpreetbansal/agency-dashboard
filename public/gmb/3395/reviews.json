He promptly baked the pizzas, which tasted good. Although I had to ask for the birthday gift they provide as well as utensils, I was allowed to bring things to the party room before my reserved time. They provide a refrigerator for your cake or a freezer for your icecream cake. I do not recall the arcade room being well advertised but it was nice to come upon. The bathrooms were clean but no paper towels are provided, just air dryers. They ask for a $150 desposit to reserve the room and give you a total(if you order extra pizzas, have extra kids, bring in outside food, etc) at the end of your party room time. Anyway, I asked about the %15 percent off sign they had in the front and Shazmo kindly applied it to my total, which was a blessing. I was greeted while leaving, even though it was a few minutes passed closing time. Overall, I recommend birthdays here.","rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-08-05T21:19:53.357735Z","update_time":"2022-08-05T21:19:53.357735Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkcM9f1zj4qtWMUCzyAEV5d8rEPAZi8Q5yW7271-trYatJrE5Fy_lPOrJempO_Bs6ZrCoiVSw","reviewer_display_name":"Sunil Kumar","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZuco_xCQXYfoB79d4-rkMnvRk0O3Nt2PMfwhFzFl4Qg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Kids Galaxy gifted my son the perfect party galaxy Oklahoma, which I could neverhave imagined.
