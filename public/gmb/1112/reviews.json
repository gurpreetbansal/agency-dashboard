That's where I found Diamond Auto Salon and they are one of the highest rated companies out there. After reading the reviews, noticing all the high end cars that they do, their lifetime warranty guarantee, and despite living 40 miles away, I knew I had to bring my car there. So, I emailed the store, and Aurian promptly replied back with a detailed explanation of his services and expectations for paint protection and tinting services. They are very experienced with all Tesla's as well for some added piece of mind.\n\nThe drop off was super easy. I didn't need a rental car but they offer one which is nice. The job took 5 days in total and the results exceeded my expectations. They help correct your paint before they begin the PPF work. I ended up going with the clear film and you can't even tell it's there! They wrap around the edges in key parts and not skip out on it like my past installer who used precut sheets. The film really keeps the car shinning like new and ceramic tint for each window which helps with UV and internal heat. They scheduled me a follow up visit to ensure all parts of the film settled in as expected. Otherwise, they will touch it up.\n\nThis is high quality work with amazing service. I have no hesitations recommending Diamond Auto Salon and I look forward to brining my future cars here. You simply can't go wrong with them.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-07-25T18:41:33.418177Z","update_time":"2022-07-25T18:41:33.418177Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmlj6QJ8PbKbyVe4QB_3AjFuMS30d-Jzjjmuw_7v9m1sjA92YIqTaj2X2E4iv12Y5LkNAuVug","reviewer_display_name":"Susie Hsiung","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvml2oJ8ivexTop6vC1z7OyRVuBo1Mg2SXmxGWuPp=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Diamond Auto Salon is the best!

The team at Diamond are experts at what they do!  They were great partners in discussing different options and providing their creative opinions in a thoughtful (not forceful) way, e.g. helping select what to wrap with gloss vs. matte black, how to match certain parts that were being wrapped to the wheels, etc.  Perhaps most importantly, the execution was 100% flawless.  This was a complete cosmetic overhaul and a big job -- lots of individual pieces either being wrapped or removed and painted -- and no detail was unconsidered or looked over.  Highly recommend Diamond Auto Spa for what they do -- which for us, was everything we wanted!  Great to find experts that could take on all that we had in mind, vs. going to multiple different shops for wrap, tint, tires\/wheels, etc.  10\/10.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-06-26T18:55:53.624293Z","update_time":"2022-06-26T18:55:53.624293Z","review_id":"AbFvOqky7T8kV83p6-AqZyUDNA3b-2GP5P-aKmmMj2IdBAv7Xqj97MWD1kKUwkJseSVm6XAQE8YnYg","reviewer_display_name":"Colin Levenson","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmnujUnc4XMcqSFe9txgu15_Qq2SF9ecZx4tHwKw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"These guys did some great work on my Tesla!!

After using a well-known business on the Westside for clear bra paint protection and getting below average results, I did an extensive search of businesses and came across Diamond Auto Salon.  I spoke with Ari, the business owner, and he gave me straightforward and honest advice.  He didn't try to up-sell me, and instead told me that I didn't need all the things I was asking for (ceramic coat plus clear bra).  He spent a lot of time discussing options, explaining what works and why, and accordingly he earned my business.\n\nI couldn't be happier with my decision.  After hiring Ari for my new SUV, I called a month later to advise that I won't be making my scheduled appointment because the shipment of my vehicle was delayed due to supply chain issues.  Ari worked with me every step of the way, and even after delivery of my vehicle, he let me store the car on his lot to avoid driving it unprotected back to Beverly Hills.  There may be folks who can do this job for less, but I haven't found anyone in Los Angeles who operates at this level of professionalism and integrity while also delivering a flawless result.

They do an excellent job with the wraps and paint protection but they also take really good care of your car while the car is at the shop. My latest project with them was a full body Stek Paint Protection Film and I just placed my order on new Vossen wheels for my new ride. Not so long ago I did another set of 21\/20 staggered Vossen wheels on another one of my cars along with H&R suspension upgrades and more. I lien on them for bringing my vision to life and they\u2019ve never let me down.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-04-20T15:58:37.180523Z","update_time":"2022-04-20T15:58:37.180523Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnPcQ_AT3qdDLqOAnNNjSQlKOn2B_gvYv1olqDCoeWHqEWvC5akBXWalFjZhDeEBzB7pf6K","reviewer_display_name":"Nicholas Frangos","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucr6ua_LfLxoqrR5Q-ezqwXE2RTmq78T-WlEsZbmZA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I have zero complaints and only the highest regards for Auri and Zach and the rest of the team at Diamond Auto Salon.

Our team did not scratch your used vehicle. We performed a paint protection film installation on your vehicles painted red surfaces. We walked around the vehicle during drop off and mentioned your vehicles black plastic trims have swirls & scratches (every gloss black vehicle trim tends to swirl up from car washes) and you approved to continue the work. Once completed, you tried to blame scratches in the same spot on us to get a full refund... This is unfair and we will not allow it. Several days later I was able to request new parts from BMW to replace these trims under warranty for you as a courtesy. I got the trims for you and set up an appointment to replace them FREE OF CHARGE to you. You responded \"No I want a refund and I will handle it myself. You guys can't touch my car again. I am paying BMW $1800 to repair it next week.\u201d\n\nFor our audience, the piece he is talking about is a gloss black trim that sits next to the fog lights of a vehicle. Aka, a $120 part from BMW we were willing to pay and replace without admitting fault to make him happy.\n\nIn the end, the client negotiated himself from a full refund to $300 after realizing the part will never cost so much to replace and he inflated it to \u201c$1800\u201d as that was the exact cost of his protection film install. Clients like this are only out for one thing and that is to get free or discounted work, not solve the issue. We are a professional business and if something were to happen to a vehicle under our roof, we will replace and fix it no questions asked! If scratching vehicles were our normal practice, we would not be a highly rated 5 star business! We will not tolerate doing a service and being demanded money back for things that can be solved in under 10 minutes. A warranty is in place for such reasons and ours is LIFETIME as we pride ourselves behind quality service and constant customer support like all our REAL reviews mention.","reply_update_time":"2022-03-01T18:26:22.892339Z"},{"create_time":"2022-03-07T23:51:51.102611Z","update_time":"2022-03-07T23:51:51.102611Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkYSs-ka-QBqpG_YQTKhcrUwkPiMJn1Dd1EywA3owD6bDoljv4mecP-WQmj73T2_TQJ2cuC","reviewer_display_name":"Andres Barahona","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmnSkUuaWwyUrhMJ8fdCuRFpGt0Pn_75Gg5FpdEN=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"EXELENT SERVICE!\nMy car looks like brand new one after a 3 stage color correction, wheels powder coating, caliper restoration and interior protection.

Auri, Noah and team are simply outstanding at their craft and have great understanding of PPF & tinting. Auri is super responsive to all the queries and is very friendly to interact with. This shop cares about the details of the work done on the vehicle... they go above and beyond to ensure the quality of work is great. We noticed a small wrinkle in the windshield film and Auri said that is not acceptable and redid that film installation for perfection. I am very impressed by their approach... Auri and team are awesome!!!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-02-19T23:36:20.625128Z","update_time":"2022-02-19T23:37:13.640355Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnydISd1Uw4STYcXlA1oH5p9gTnXxll41zxquqOe7FVOY2SAfzpUAKaPmvFftN2O4yoPnal1A","reviewer_display_name":"Kyle Vincent","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucpA0D6JGhDJhNihqdnVwv9ggQyDQXaxlgEiNnEv=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Had a 10\/10 experience at Diamond Auto Salon, dropped off my 2018 M3 for a Paint correction, Full car PPF, and ceramic tints all the way around.
