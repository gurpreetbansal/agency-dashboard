Quite simply the best around, I sold in Tasman and Debbie and the team were more than happy to literally go the extra mile!! Could not recommend highly enough!!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-02-22T23:21:54.197319Z","update_time":"2022-02-22T23:21:54.197319Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmHhm8aJLrLrdjE_6ILkjEuRi35H5Bh-WaKw31fIINtK2Ki_MFclpvtMxfo3fIB1dqAs6Z6","reviewer_display_name":"Brian Robert Radke","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmn-ENmFmG6iEM0dCVm7jPQrldcb5WEt3qI40XNhUA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"The entire Debbie Cooper Group was a pleasure to work with, but working with Debbie herself was outstanding. She was professional, listened to our concerns, and guided us around some rare problems we came up against. Upon meeting her she respected all aspects of the process; the house, the vendors and the buyers. We would use her again in an instant and highly recommend her if you want the process of buying or selling your house done right.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-02-17T04:33:29.283371Z","update_time":"2022-02-17T04:33:54.850854Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmWdQHytf6_7Ne7zmZKWQL6r1oXQeYdoRzr0Od3Z9Rh1OD0QNWntXH9Scy_xizSG6csWUkvYw","reviewer_display_name":"Nellie Matthews","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucpACXhJ6bIt6_DBa8vyaZlYZ80me-eLiJxzT_UbFA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Debbie Cooper and her team provided an excellent service that sets them apart in their field.
