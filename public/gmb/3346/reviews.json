He and his colleague showed up on time and were both so courteous,  I felt like we were in good hands right away.  After the inspection David asked if I would like a summary since it would take until later that evening to receive my report.  We sat for about an hour (sorry David) because I had so many questions.  David took his time not only explaining but educating me on his findings.  When I received his report, I was so impressed with his attention to detail! It's hard to find people these days that are really good at what they do, and and take the extra time to really help you, but David is one of these people!  It was truly a blessing to work with him and I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for an inspector! Thank you and God Bless you David!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-06-22T18:04:17.681931Z","update_time":"2022-06-22T18:04:17.681931Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnklhht6RifGlq30ZDiIm6nehXrSUyJrmoblUz0XL8lKKVoVBv_m4e9SHKxL5yFoVpJlBk2eg","reviewer_display_name":"Dayenis Driggs","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmlyPJJ9pdSByWCKTE5a6292ICeInH9GedZpMHPr=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"(Translated by Google) A very professional inspector, I recommend him 100%, I loved his work.\n\n(Original)\nUn inspector muy profecional, lo recomiendo al 100% me encanto su trababajo.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-05-23T22:55:04.892177Z","update_time":"2022-05-23T22:55:04.892177Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlp-8cIjroRNrkKG5HmZh9RPnkoIsm8VBX2KzMC32rxg4HcFsv_TbuRS2bt8gJZEVj5lllF3g","reviewer_display_name":"MariBaller","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmlLcx8zrJR3t39FYrg-jZ35OwGjQ-g78A7Ed4Rf=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Really enjoyed talking to David and noticing his attention to details when inspecting my future home.

I am not surprised at how many overwhelming 5-star reviews he has. Let me share why I chose 5 stars....\n\nDavid has inspected multiple properties for me and I will continue to hire him as he is consistently efficient, insightful, knowledgeable, and he embodies integrity. I've been very pleased with all three inspections he has done for me.\n\nThis last inspection he was an integral part of when I had a re-inspect in which the seller's fix it guy faked a electrician's license number. It was David's feedback that led me to go look up the license which I learned was fraudulent.\n\nThis experience has brought out the best in this company. He is exactly why you hire inspectors. It saves you from making a large purchase in which people say are repaired but we're not. He protects you from fraudulent claims and from bad repair jobs as well.\n\nHe is thorough and because of that quality, we have caught instances where plumbing was left unconnected and running water was seen under the home (not all inspectors would have caught this).\n\nFurther, he hires out the termite portion of the inspection and even that guy is incredible!  The reports are fantastically detailed so the professional can go in and fix what needs to be fixed. They're also written in a clear and concise manner so the average person can understand where there may be deficiencies.\n\nGood luck and thank you, David!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-11-05T18:54:32.083196Z","update_time":"2020-11-05T18:59:04.202226Z","review_id":"AbFvOql-YHo1iz49d4XsU-9hgMNyZgsoWqhx0A0tY-5TJ1mMtyzKOIX-AG3U2Z7Ra3hZXZX7kGHe","reviewer_display_name":"Sebastian August","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmmjPBmD2P6BIDrVPsNgmZ_wS5-E9kCG1IERdkIQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"If I could give David more than 5 stars I would!

He's friendly, professional, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable. We had an accepted offer in on a house, and were certain it was the right place for us. However, Mr. Monsivais found several issues that required our attention: improperly installed roof, an HVAC system that was not fully functional AND improperly installed to the point that gas would leak when the valve was engaged, water leaks from the improperly installed roof, and many other problems. Additionally, the house had extremely significant termite damage through about 1\/4 of the property, which we learned from EPest, a company that David partners with.\n\nUltimately, we decided to rescind our offer on the house because Mr. Monsivais was honest & straight-forward. What a RELIEF to have not wasted a significant amount of money in purchasing a money pit. We would have been upside-down in the house before we ever got in it, and David kept us from making a horrible mistake.\n\nMr. Monsivais ensured two things from us:\n1) We will not hire another home inspector unless he's not available in our option period.\n2) We will recommend him above all others to our friends.\n\nThank you, David. You have helped our family make a great decision during one of the most important periods in our lives.\n\nWe'll be hiring Mr. Monsivais again - hopefully, he'll have better news for us the second time around!

After many phone calls and talking to many inspectors, everything was very overwhelming for me. David was the last person that I called and I immediately knew after my conversation with him that he was the perfect choice.  He took the time to explain to me his entire process.  And he told me that if I wanted to hire his company, give him a call back to schedule.  I  told him that I needed to talk to my husband about everything. I seriously  sent him a text within 10 minutes  and told him that he was hired.  Later that day, he sent me an awesome video of him working on a roof.  Fast forward to today, our inspection day, David showed up right before our appointment time.  He introduced himself and told us what to expect and he immediately got to work.  He walked us through the entire inspection and explained everything to us. I was amazed at how thorough he was.  After reading all the amazing reviews about his company, it is what I expected, but to actually see it happening was a very good feeling and I knew I made the perfect choice.  David has amazing rates and  you will not regret hiring him for your home inspection.  He is super friendly and I am very happy with our selection.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so very much.
