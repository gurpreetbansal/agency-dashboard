Upon my arrival, Gigi gave me a tour of her whole facility and I was impressed with how clean and lush everything is. I loved the feel and smell of all of the products she used, and all of the special comforts (like slippers and cover-ups) make you feel like a VIP. But more importantly, I was immediately elated when I actually saw my face glowing; real and beautiful results. I had a chiropractor appointment afterwards, and the first thing she said to me was \"your face is glowing\"! I would definitely recommend this procedure and Enhance Image!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so much Angela!
