We scheduled a move-out cleaning for our rental house. Raylene walked me through the whole process and everything that they do for their cleaning services, and how they guarantee satisfaction in their work for you and for the property management company\/landlord if you\u2019re renting. I could tell even over the phone that she has a ton of experience and is very knowledgeable. She texted a few days before to remind me of the appointment and when they would be arriving, as well as when they were ~30 min out from arriving. We had a 2600 square foot house and they had it thoroughly cleaned and spotless including carpet cleaning in about 5 and a half hours! The house smelled and looked cleaner than it\u2019s probably ever been as a rental. Raylene was a true pleasure to work with and they really do go above and beyond with their cleaning.
