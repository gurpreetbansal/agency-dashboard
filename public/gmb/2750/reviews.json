I started to lose hope as I couldn\u2019t do my regular house chores and normal hygiene routine. I heard of Dr Moore and how great he was from my daughter. I decided to see him and I\u2019m so glad I did! In 4 weeks I\u2019ve had major improvements in my shoulder to where I can do normal activities again without excruciating pain. Still have some time to heal but to be expected. Thank you Dr Moore for your kindness, understanding, and professional expertise.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Jenna - thank you so much for taking time to share your experience.

I was at the point that I could not do my job and knew I needed to address the problem. I reached out to Dr Moore to avoid surgery. He was able to assess and treat me quickly. I am now able to do my job without restriction or pain.\nI highly recommend Dr Moore and his team.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Dan, we are so glad you reached out to us and that we could help get you back to normal 'life' without pain.
