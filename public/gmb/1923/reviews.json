We were worried about the installation as we just got the porch done with decorative concrete, Stefan informed us not to worry as he has worked with this before.  Stefan was incredibly helpful and professional with every step of this project. He provided me with different options and was the most reasonably priced out of the 3 different companies I approached. He suggested an open style and colour to match our house.   The installers were super nice and professional and worked with us.  I am super happy with the way my porch looks now. I would highly recommend Aztec Aluminum Railings in a minute.   Thank you.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for the review!\n\nStay safe,\nStefan","reply_update_time":"2021-09-08T20:06:22.021Z"},{"create_time":"2020-12-01T18:08:28.048Z","update_time":"2020-12-01T18:08:28.048Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlyK9klBlrP1mHndfaxk9-xWymMINTyN4NjqKkDQjYO42vJfktk1Xf4oVa3-zEOW45pQtv_","reviewer_display_name":"Stefan R","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gig91vmgCMKew2ivAuAyxuAGfJsPLiD6Ghu46zs=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I recently used Aztec to install aluminum railings and a hand rail, they did an amazing job. I would definitely refer them to anyone that is interested in getting aluminum railings done. Keep up the great work.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""}]}
