Only received a response with an apology two months later, where they made the excuse that my message was \"accidentally archived\". By then my child had already completed tuition with another school.\n(2) Some time later I made a payment for the trial course and sent the proof of payment. Waited days, but no acknowledgement nor receipt from them. Only after much coaxing, received receipt almost 2 weeks later. Not even a note of acknowledgement, very unprofessional.\n(3) Their website design is terrible. The registration form for some webinar doesn't make sense, it's just a standard form to enroll the student and not for the webinar. The webinar advertisement also didn't indicate it's meant for JC2 students. Then there's that annoying advertisement pop up that appears every time you try to fill up the form, and it forces your form to refresh such that whatever you had filled up turns blank again. So we gave up, and my child is happily enrolled with Learner's Lodge. Same price, but such difference in the service and responsiveness.\n\nI give 2 stars as I believe the tutor may be good (based on our limited trial experience). But doesn't help if their admin doesn't get things done, which really is a waste.","rating":"TWO","review_reply":"Hi thank you for the valuable feedback. In respond to their feedback:\n\n1. I can certainly share your frustration. However, it was indeed true that your message was archived as you had indicated that you will not be enrolling since you have found alternatives. So we have archived your messages. During the holiday it was also the period where manpower is low and the centre is closed for a break as well. In any case, we have placed 2 numbers on our website so you could contact the alternatives.\n\n2. Similarly, your message was archived. Hence there was no way the admin would have noted your message on your payment. In any case, we were still waiting for the rest to make payment prior to the receipt to be sent to everyone together. We generally will respond to parent to provide an acknowledgment as well. Upon your message on facebook, the person in charged has also called you and clairfied immediately.\n\n3. I am glad that you managed to find another tuition centre for your child. However, to clarify that while it was not stated in the webinar the target audience, however the topics that we will be touching on has been stated. While granted that it could have been clearer that it is more suitable for JC2, we do welcome JC1 to join if they feel that its beneficial to them. Afterall, its the strategy to the question solving that we will be sharing. I believe your daughter who have came for the trial should have witnessed it herself as well.\n\nJust like any other tuition centre, there are always rooms for improvement. We are doing our best to improve on our systems to make it better. We certainly value your feedback will do better.\n\nIf you need further clarifications, do come by and have a chat with us. We will do what we could to help you to the best of our ability.","reply_update_time":"2022-03-15T07:45:53.557Z"},{"create_time":"2022-02-23T15:50:01.053Z","update_time":"2022-02-23T15:50:01.053Z","review_id":"AbFvOqk56VKty7GTuA3zPPuZO7taT0bAhxLbaTEc1K4P3y2XT6lPTgxPFkRgL91Mdk9QaUZkl_7w","reviewer_display_name":"Tan Hwee Kheng","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gg2CbXYgS9q0iHrTuHfKVlRBmAtLK5UUdtAS-ZdEg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Approached Leon late in April 2021 for Physics tuition to my nephew whose result has been poor since JC1.
