My regular dentist was closed so then made many phone calls to local dentists, none of which could fit me in. After extending my search a little wider I called Morton Dental and bingo they could fit me in, straight away :-) Dr Henry saw me, had a look and said we can possibly save the veneer and recement in on. Job done. Great work Henry and thanks to the lovely lady on reception too. I would certainly recommend Morton Dental.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-10-31T00:58:18.668Z","update_time":"2019-10-31T00:58:18.668Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmPr-EIurN8dHJURzbW_5ASn17s7og0Hi-SNXkpQd6z42sedtl9-Ud8sz3Ucr-wZEsByW6ppQ","reviewer_display_name":"Janina","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJy-gdcbvF-WJ-99ZojAftT4eV_iUvGKziLzR8vt=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great service and lovely team!
