If the phone was disconnected or the call was dropped, we would not be able to reach you unless you called back or we had your number.\nAll of our orders are done online via our website, we worked hard and spent a lot of money to be able to provide our customers with this.\nWe did check our email and noticed that you and your wife sent us an email on May 21st asking for a cake on June 4th. We responded on May 22nd to let you know that we were fully booked for that weekend due to the overflow of covid19 weddings and other custom orders. We made a few suggestions for other options, and mentioned that all custom cakes require at least 3 weeks notice depending on design.\nWe really hope you can try us again, we would love to create you something amazing and delicious.","reply_update_time":"2022-07-29T13:17:13.316327Z"},{"create_time":"2022-07-25T15:14:00.417742Z","update_time":"2022-07-25T15:14:00.417742Z","review_id":"AbFvOqn9F3zVt_q5e3SfpRthb1KSixSUivAyh0Z4GU5wZEbcoa4YDvCbtzUFkI_aPt5FlXdPNQlErQ","reviewer_display_name":"Christine Soares","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucqHfucTQdeQoZQ15pFDy7FpG2CYCuatDdRkLYwivw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I had ordered my wedding cake from The Rolling Pin and met with Isabelle.

Our guests were raving about the donuts for weeks after the wedding \u2013 we only had ~70 guests and yet, managed to finish 120 mini donuts (!!) so clearly, they were a huge hit.\n\nRolling Pin made it easy to pick up a complimentary wedding cake tasting box (all 4 flavours we tried were delicious, in the end, chocolate won out) and let us pick 10 different flavours of donuts for the rest of the \u201ccake\u201d. We love that the flavours are all really unique and well balanced (nothing was ever too sweet) and of course, the donuts are obviously beautiful. We asked for a naked cake to go with our relatively simple d\u00e9cor and the cake was also delicious \u2013 really moist, rich, chocolatey \u2026 everything you\u2019d want in a chocolate cake, really.

I was told by Vanessa that the rolling pin would make this cake for me for my birthday and that the price for a 9\u201d cake would be $145. Although pricey, I agreed since I thought this would be exactly what I asked for and hopefully worth the price. You would assume that for this price the cake would at least have real cherries. Instead, what I received for $145 was an overpriced Black Forest cake that I could have easily gotten from a random grocery story for $40. At my birthday party of 20 people, I sliced into my cake and felt immediate disappointment. What I saw was a chocolate cake (overly sweet with no flavour) with dollar store quality maraschino cherries and a thick layer of frosting. No one ate the cake because it tasted like sweet garbage. One bite = 1 cavity. Instead of putting a $145 price tag on the box, there should be a health warning label.\n\nInitially, I really did not want to post this review and emailed Vanessa to express disappointment. I did not expect anything in return aside from an acknowledgment email and maybe an apology. However, just like the rest of the negative comments here say, Customer service sucks even more than the cakes, which is pretty hard to do.\n\nWill not be returning.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-04-03T14:47:00.171405Z","update_time":"2022-04-03T14:47:27.827492Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkV44EdEYYFeHrRNz3M4Z_JbF6fuFzS6CLLuagzSDqeudp9pII_LHmPafgpkAjYqmBSXUOd","reviewer_display_name":"Jimmey Rampersad","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucqLHeL_INK4wd9oiFm_MoQGlpZS83YI6xXChud2SQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great bakery, I originally went there for a Nutella donut but unfortunately I did not see it.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-04-02T19:35:49.647536Z","update_time":"2022-04-02T19:35:49.647536Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkDV3bcwsxa8IyLiaTNA_Bxp1Z-sSlFPTpJlURI2UufjhHsYyFj-HFFwK4PsbMt-VMQOMbpsw","reviewer_display_name":"Hitesh Mashru","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucqI3-_wqzFgKjGwwoh33Tvrsj61rk2GLuTgaYXYkw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-03-24T17:19:46.964009Z","update_time":"2022-03-24T17:19:46.964009Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlBs_Z_vD1bhMJdZP52LtUimVViyvqesiTX4Q_GftgXhHWF5ZUge8efH-vpoLFXQDVfp9mOpg","reviewer_display_name":"Ryan Knight","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucoSCDEMFC-X61NeRsVLirAcuxtJSwxJU3bZSqcDzw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-03-19T03:12:06.166042Z","update_time":"2022-03-19T03:12:06.166042Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmdhG715vJj3HVtOa_d0_kuqRw0n8in7MG2rzpbBpBjP9ZUQvzdlUDG93YThIfz7F1W28Z8","reviewer_display_name":"Carlton C","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucokAOfMHneyWVTxCS2Aexk7Ln6YiioxQmr5dVcOyA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Low selection of donuts when I visited in the morning.","rating":"THREE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-03-18T07:15:49.296180Z","update_time":"2022-03-18T07:15:49.296180Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlFEwLrzoB8FK1cVATUvXhAeUPCILEGbtSjgweqVthIM42-pwGHxHoRjiXDtxouiFNgFeeM-Q","reviewer_display_name":"Helen Miller","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucofZ3Ry50i97AQYXbf9D0ImtOwlSfBc2V27IBqc=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Cozy place and quick service","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-03-15T16:26:52.479869Z","update_time":"2022-03-15T16:26:52.479869Z","review_id":"AbFvOqknDB4cfldQgmeu5SGqRMeZpFe-jahCe08Qt8MK55AxbS-SxudSy6D1jFzTIO16mCuv0pKc9w","reviewer_display_name":"Peter Cerrito","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucqWvHAaXycsasFzFkeZbxLf37QZhJBTJlLrGQL4rik=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-03-13T20:03:39.890006Z","update_time":"2022-03-13T20:03:39.890006Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlmoyOwiadtUIw5Euw-yqF_7CC8XouEs20m5mZXfvIKbYllILnwplqGMd41k5Vg-KqTTHmwxA","reviewer_display_name":"Tamar Taejoian","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucoHvaHAv_tuiryrFopR0p6fqKJrf_u7geYBxURv=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"We bought Cherry Pie yesterday and for me it\u2019s one of the most delicious pies I\u2019ve had in a while.
