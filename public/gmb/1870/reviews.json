Project Manager Aaron VanDerMolen was a pleasure to work with. He worked with us for months to determine the best financing and design options for our roof.

We are so pleased with their work and the professionalism of Aaron VanDerMolen that we are now in discussions of redoing our siding, upgrading the chimney and front entryway as well as replacing windows and redirecting pesky gutters.

Currently working on a small project and the contractor that I am working with indicated that before they could finish the job, some siding needed to be repaired.  I got online and read through some great reviews Titan Construction received so I decided to give them a call.  I spoke to their friendly and knowledgeable staff and provided pictures via my phone of the damage that required repair.  I received a call from Phil that same day and he offered to stop by the house to see the work that needed to be done.  Since Titan provided a fair quote, I decided to work with Phil.  I really appreciated that Phil took into account that I had contractors waiting for the siding to be repaired before the project could be completed.  Due to the age of my home, the siding that is currently on my home is no longer manufactured but Phil took the extra steps to ensure that the color and pattern of the siding that Titan was going to install matched the siding I have on my home. Furthermore, within four business days, there was a crew member at my home doing the repairs.  The repair person took great care and was detailed to make sure that the repair was done correctly and that everything looked right.  The old siding was hauled away by Titan so i did not have to be concerned with disposal.  Phil called me a couple of days before to ensure that I would be home during the repair and called me on the day of the repair to ensure that everything was going as planned.  Phil kept me informed throughout the entire process which brought me peace of mind that i had hired the right contractor.  Thanks Phil and the Titan Team for providing a great experience and look forward to working with you again in the near future.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you Giovanni!

I had abdominal surgery and was in the hospital for a few days and have been recovering at home. Titan Construction (Lysette and Nathan) made my life easy by keeping on the management company to ensure they approved the better materials with a longer warranty.\n\nThe roof itself looks great and the team was able to finish it within one day. Our neighbors had our original company replace their roof and the cleanup was awful. We had garbage all throughout our yard from their workers. Titan Construction on the other hand was very thorough and made sure to clean up everything. They missed a few roofing nails in the grass, but that's to be expected. Everything else was pristine.

From each layer to the shingles.  Before the crew began the tear-off, a dumpster was placed in our driveway, they took the necessary precautions to cover all windows.\nWhen the crew started tear-off they also informed us of other issues that were needed. IE:  making our garage roof level, skylight replacement.\nWith Titan Construction also handling gutters, we had them install new gutters with the \u2018gutter goalies\u2019 (no need to clean anymore)\nThe total process was 1 1\/2 days, for the things we wanted and needed.  After completion, Titan Construction made sure all materials were cleaned up. They even went around the home, with a large magnet, looking for nails, screws, etc.  All was spotless before asking us \u201cif all was completed to our satisfaction\u201d.\nAgain, along with Aaron Vandermolen, his assistant Joshua Skummer and the crew kept us informed as needed. Also answering any questions\/concerns we had.\nWe would definitely, without doubt, recommend Titan Construction for all your needs.  They were professional, knowledgeable, courteous, etc.  the way you would like to be treated.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so much Nancy.

When other companies were telling us the job would be scheduled months out, Titan was able to get our job in as soon as possible due to our circumstances. Our siding looks wonderful and it didn't break the bank. We've had many neighbors complimenting the work and asking who completed it. I would highly recommend Titan to anyone looking for new siding.

The guys arrived on time and finished the job in only a few hours. You can tell they are very experienced. After they left it was so clean that it was like no one was even here! Overall fantastic job and I highly recommend Titan Construction Enterprises to anyone who needs work done to their home.
