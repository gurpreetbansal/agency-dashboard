Yesterday, I get a piece of mail from them and I'm thinking, GREAT, here's where a company tries to cold call me into some contract 'cuz I just bought a new house.  I open the letter and what do I find?  A nice letter explaining that my closing attorney also paid them out of closing costs (I should've paid closer attention but didn't) and a reimbursement check for the inspection cost.  WHAT?!?

Inspector came out (late)went into crawlspace and upon exiting went on to tell me he's a contractor on the side and for $100 more he could go in and remove insulation to look for further damage. The home was currently occupied and the inspector was unable to look at the water heater and the garage. He also claimed he couldn't move pine needles away from the base exterior of the house because he would be there too long. We eventually decided against the home due to further inspection so I receive a call to pay the bill and they want full payment for half a job. After being told my realtor needs to send me elsewhere next time to find a termite inspector, the receptionist agreed to have me pay half the bill. Unprofessional and lazy! Wasn't planning on returning for next termite inspection and wouldn't recommend!","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"I am very sorry you have had a negative experience with our company. We always strive to satisfy our customers. It is never a desire to disappoint anyone. Please allow me to respond publicly to your comments and offer our position to other readers. As for the time of arrival there is a window to allow for the inspector to arrive. We cannot and do not give an exact time as to the arrival. We allow for an hour for each service and drive time. At times traffic, is a bear. Also, perhaps the customer at the previous home required a little more time to explain the service. The owner, Johnnie, was the inspector at your home . He is not a contractor \u201con the side\u201d, he is a license NC General Contractor. Our company does not remove the insulation on homes prior to a service. That indeed would be more than the fee you paid as that altogether would be a separate service requiring much more time thus a larger fee. Our inspections are visible inspections as to what the inspector sees at the time of inspection. If there is an area that is covered that is preventing the area to be completely inspected, that is indicated on the report. Nonetheless, there is no removal of items on your home to do the inspection. A complete home inspection by a home inspector would be the person you need to call for that type of inspection. Our company looks for visible signs of wood destroying insects and other conducive conditions. The service was performed and yes we asked for payment for the service we completed. It was a complete service and not a partial service. If you would like the portion of the home to be inspected that is covered in full insulation, perhaps having someone to remove the insulation of the entire area prior to the inspection would be helpful to your next inspection and your next home. Thank you again for the partial payment.","reply_update_time":"2018-06-13T22:13:54.756Z"},{"create_time":"2017-05-01T01:52:40.623Z","update_time":"2017-05-01T01:52:40.623Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmvv7-bMeRsvFKqjtD5rMcz4vyL4VdpC3KDiWgRPQNwVjtFL3RASI8jYo6CtpdWFoIVspzQ1Q","reviewer_display_name":"Tammy Henderson","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmlGry-cp9kd4lk_vS09s2lvaIWPJefDTWdE12MY=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2015-11-25T01:38:45.292Z","update_time":"2015-11-25T01:38:45.292Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkhnOp25ojQdNT2HsCywDwdxaU4bdvYe3ONU7DAVlp4fexboRkG0wOsALmRq6JGnEbxRD5UcA","reviewer_display_name":"Michelle Johnson","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucrlhXHJlm4BKQV3fLoSWXvE89Lopgbzg2il3YmKDQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2013-12-22T22:55:12.941Z","update_time":"2013-12-22T22:55:12.941Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlIDul7vZV1GktUyzTYCiSYRT_NsvIhayoYP0PFa83rHSDF9jPgJwRM7xKrxGYQa3OMM3binQ","reviewer_display_name":"Jourdan Velazquez","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucrhRIzarBW2M-QbPO5XUQ-s4-njGFJ6rQE1ug_N=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great work, highly recommend, explained all products they used and what for and even came back out when I notice some bugs.
