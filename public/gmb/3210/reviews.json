I had a technician come out to look at my air conditioning problem and he thought that it might be the fan and was unsure.  He stated he was going to order one and install it if the problem persisted, but he was not 100% sure that was the problem.  The technician ended up stating that he was told by the owner that this was the issue without question and installed it.  This was not the case.  After the repair my system was left with the same problem hours after the technician left only to be told he would be out to check it in the morning and to turn the unit off until then.  I informed the technician that I had a small window in the morning and the technician stated that he would be able to do whatever it was he needed to.  The technician showed up with 20 minutes to spare before knowing that I needed to leave for an appointment and within a couple minutes topped off my refrigerant and the system was immediately working fine and has since.  It is odd to me that this fix was so apparent and immediately fixed this problem after a $400.00 repair that prior day and was not something that was checked the prior day before any expensive repairs were made.  I emailed the owner and feel I as though it fell on deaf ears and got nowhere with my concern.  Being as though I am not a HVAC repair person I consulted a couple other companies who stated a similar course of action collectively that was different than this company used.  I am just sharing my experience and you so that you can use this in your decision making when you need to.\n\nIn addition to what happened above I had Airxtreme out for a repair on my A\/C as my usual company was booked.  They completed the repair and when I went to pay I was surprised with an additional fee.  I went to pay by credit card and was told that there was an additional 3.25% as that is what the credit card company charges them and this was a convenience to me.  This was never mentioned at the time of scheduling and when I called and voiced my opinion I was told that they normally have this on their work orders.  I told her that I did not get a work order until I paid and that obviously not help as again this is after the fact.  I won't do business with them in the future.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-07-20T23:47:01.993Z","update_time":"2018-07-20T23:47:01.993Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkjdB7_3rsakCH-wj5KCw115nF23D6-vIoyGVHgyvjanhOGa3OVjY4YsbOOPxJdAIQOFAbc0Q","reviewer_display_name":"David Jankow","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucoQ09fcfLi3a88hKhDt0a84w6xPes6cONAe0ZJAcQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great service and a fair price.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-07-20T16:40:23.238Z","update_time":"2018-07-20T16:40:23.238Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmDreL1AkpoaChHGdZJOTV9AI8qN9NZleh1iKOg2GYPH6kCTIqSbvQDN-x2rTUtFtHeTly9","reviewer_display_name":"Nancy Jankow","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmldbLx4oAPnhno-3qbywAETP8td2_kC5IDKY0u-=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2017-07-20T20:32:05.878Z","update_time":"2017-07-20T20:32:05.878Z","review_id":"AbFvOqn6VPmF1faa-Mv1cXDlp5EkzfZr2OD6vRTPFs4B9P6smr2Gt1bcJEmtj5OtCZcUf5EOcwtjAQ","reviewer_display_name":"Megan Neeley","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucoXCzp_waHGGzbER6-h--UTzYx27vfuygg8pv_a=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"These guys got out to our house when our A\/C was on the fritz and it was 98 outside so fast.
