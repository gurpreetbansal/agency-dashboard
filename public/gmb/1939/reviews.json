I went in, got a very vague quote, asked to set up a profile, which they obviously didn\u2019t.\nI went back in on Friday May 3 to place an order and the girl told me then that my profile wasn\u2019t set up. She told me that the system was down and they weren\u2019t able to do anything. She told me to hang on for a few minutes while she set me up in the system to place my order.\nI waited for over an hour, when I looked over to see what the hold up was, I noticed she hadn\u2019t set me up and she was doing some other work, I walked out to never return. I went to their competitor down the street and I was set up in there system and placed my order within a few minutes.

I am disappointed that we did not get your business.\nI will speak to my staff but I do request if you may send me the email from 3 weeks ago with the quote specs request so I can review with my staff as to why we did not quote in a timely fashion. Call in and ask for me and I will provide my email address as I do want to place any fixes with my CSR's.

I requested a quote on April 14th and to this day (April 26th), I still have not received a formal quote.  Your claim is 24 hour turnaround for a quote is it not?  So in a panic and extreme urgency to bid on a job before I lost it, I was finally able to get someone to give me a rough price per linear foot of glass railing over the phone.  (Which no doubt will most likely be wrong).\n\nEvery time I call the lady that answers gives me a new story.  Mostly having to do with corrupt software that crashes halfway through working on a quote.  At this point I think, can this not be solved with a piece of paper and a pencil, but that's not my business.  Every time I call she says \"I will call you back in 10 minutes\" and never does.  Every time I call she says she has it right in front of her and she is working on it, but she never is.  I know this because yesterday, (April 24) she emailed me and asked for specifics on the railing needed to quote it (like height, style, post size etc).  If she really had ever opened the quote I would have been asked these questions 2 weeks ago.\n\nAt least when michelle was there I was never endlessly lied to.  If she was behind she just told me and I was good with that.  I understand.  But enough with the bs.  You claim to never turn down clients, so I really don't know what this is.\n\nSorry pino, I really didn't want to get into this, but you asked.

Concord Aluminum Railings is a manufacturer for over 15 years and is well known in the industry. Unfortunately, we do not sell direct to the public our railings but will sell columns, solar lights, fencing, some railing replacement components, and a few other items direct to the public. As for railings, they are left to our professional install companies we sell direct to and they work with home owners. Their expertise will ensure a smooth supply and install process. Potential home owners looking for Concord Aluminum Railings products, we always provide a direct reference of one of our professional contractors we sell to in their area so they can receive optimal service. By having a potential customer call in, they get the product they want through the appropriate channels. We take away the challenge for them to locate a contractor selling our products.","reply_update_time":"2018-08-09T18:12:37.611Z"}]}
