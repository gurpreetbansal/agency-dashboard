I co worker suggested Schultz. I phoned and had the pleasure of speaking with Dallas. This guy knows Duramax's like the back of his hand. After speaking to Dallas for a half hour he knew problems i have been fighting for the past 5 plus years. Mainly overheating while towing. He suggested a few fixes. I agreed and booked in my truck for a transmission replacement and the other modifications he suggested. I dropped off the truck and left it with him for a week. Dallas kept me in the loop thoughout the repairs. I paid the bill and had my wife pick up my truck. A day after i got home i loaded up and took off on a 1700km holiday towing my 8000 pound travel trailer and hauling my 2 quads to Idaho.\nIn the past my truck would hit 230 and 240 degrees. With the mods the transmission shifted like a dream and i never hit more then 210 degrees. I can't believe how much better everything worked. Thanks Schultz Diesel and team for bullet proofing my Duramax. I will be a customer for life.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Hey, Kurt!
