Gradually an unruly puppy that jumped on everything that moved turned into a well-behaved dog.

I am a behavioral psychologist and learned a little about Bart Bellon\u2019s accomplishments in canine training & behavior.

I reached out to her with a dog that would not recall after trying every treat in the book and working on it for about an hour each day. She would also pull and chase skateboards; anything with wheels. Mara sat down with us and helped create a training program specifically tailored to Maze and her needs. She connected with maze instantly and helped me immediately control the pulling. After just 4 sessions Mara was able to train Maze as well as myself to get Maze to a point where her recall was flawless and she could walk around the park without a leash and ignore any distractions. We now go backpacking, backcountry skiing, and have a much tighter bond. The training always continues and Mara still responds to my texts when I have questions that come up.

I spent weeks with these trainers and too much money (it\u2019s embarrassing) and they couldn\u2019t accomplish what Mara did in ONE DAY. She was so kind but firm with her training, my dogs Juniper (7years old) and Aspen (just turned 1) loved to listen to her and she taught me how to properly communicate so we can continue our loving relationship. Before Mara Juniper pulled on leash when other dogs where around and REALLY wanted to chase deer and rabbit although she was an excellent runner. Now she stays glued to my side (and gets rewarded generously). Aspen, being the Australian cattle dog that he is, is FULL of energy and pulled aggressively when running, he doesn\u2019t pull at all and is working toward not having to greet every dog when passing.
