Previously I had trouble landing worthwhile interviews despite trying so hard by sending out numerous applications. The few that bothered to get back were quick to dismiss me in favor of other candidates. I could not understand why I was so unlucky when I was qualified for the positions I was applying for. A friend of mine took one look at my resume and immediately told me that it was poorly written. He suggested that I rewrite it using a template he provided, which I did. However, my luck did not improve much. In frustration, I scoured the internet for professional resume writing services and came across Do My Resume. I just had to provide some details regarding my qualifications and experience and they wrote an impeccable resume from scratch. My fortune changed overnight. Most of the applications I sent out went through and I was invited to interviews.

In combination with a succinct cover letter elegantly stating my skills and goals, my revamped resume landed me a tremendous new role several bumps above my regular pay grade.\n\nI'm confident I wouldn't have got this job without the services provided by them because I wouldn't have had that LinkedIn profile which ended up being the key to landing my new job, so I'm sure when I say it was thanks to them and their services that I'm back in the office today.\n\nThe best way I can express my thanks as well as pay it forward to others seeking the same leg up is by sharing my story and own thumbs up to anyone struggling with their own job search.\n\n10\/10 definitely recommend, would use again!\n\nThank you for everything Do My Resume!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-09-18T14:17:40.009Z","update_time":"2019-09-18T14:17:40.009Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmUCoSu9q3PBGcyZXBDzjGCJIP7qdVD2IORIuRW4pwKFLHY4NRvSxMsGNTgGaS1u73CEApc","reviewer_display_name":"Ralph","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gj6viIYLiCm0Yh3g20t6mKvmedYI77bBv5w93DOH8g=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Do My Resume are the best!

Then I found Do My Resume. I didn\u2019t really trust online services that I don\u2019t hear about often, so I researched and asked my friends about it. Some who used it before recommended it, saying that it was the \u201cbest resume-writing service ever\u201d! Without further hesitation, I asked for help from the professionals there. In less than 72 hours, they helped me to push me a step closer to my final goal! I never regretted asking for their service.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2017-07-06T15:18:02.055Z","update_time":"2017-07-06T15:18:02.055Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkDllSf0c0ifUTbzZ-v1IOLjGyEjY-alyQ91Z8iuX521-IZKDjahQLBaXPFVTZpvLojJhga","reviewer_display_name":"Carmaletta Street","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjqwbMl9ZDgFEhGBqD15dPPr34DZtri6gwYwOqx2A=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I've been searching for a great company to have my resume  cv, cover letter done on my linkedIn profile thanks to them it made a difference.
