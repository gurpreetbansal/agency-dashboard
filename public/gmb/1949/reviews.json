Although the journey was a bit longer than Dr. Muradov had expected, he did not give up on finding solutions and consequently, he provided me with solutions for fatigue as well as support through the ugly menopause stages.  Although this route is not inexpensive, I am very fortunate to have found Dr. Muradov and his support staff Jackie. Dr. Muradov was great with communicating with me via email so to save me a few office visits.  I am sad that our current healthcare system does not support Naturopaths and our additional health insurance programs are also very insufficient. This form of healthcare is so much more supportive and preventative than our traditional form of healthcare in yet our system sees them as less inferior. How many more people could be living healthier lives without depending on endless medications if they could only access this form of healthcare?","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-02-26T17:49:55.515Z","update_time":"2019-02-26T17:49:55.515Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnSGifZQxVm8j4eMx5wnvE0y1hHN7hEckdtIOTkP7UlDEmiA6aErkJ3aj3V8ZZy3F7utRCFbA","reviewer_display_name":"Vanessa Simonin","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxQvAULQ0_gcAHElsRw63R98e6tHZeWHQEqoodH=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I visited Dr. Muradov after a couple of years trying to figure out what was wrong with me. My GP finally narrowed the issue down to Fibromyalgia, which felt a little like a blanket term for the issues I was having, and the medication with helps with neuropathic pain, as only a bandaid, being that it's effectiveness decreased within months of starting it. Even during the first visit, Dr. Muradov was able to give me some pointers about typical presentations of fibro- like sluggish mitochondria, which isn't something I had even been able to find in my own online searching for answers. By the second appointment, my pain had virtually gone, my good days far outnumbered my bad days. I've been doing vitamin and magnesium IV's and I feel great! Dr. Muradov helped me to avoid costly testing, while helping me to get relief from the pain. I've not felt this good in literally years. I do plan to do some comprehensive testing AHS can't do (which Dr. Muradov doesn't profit from, btw, as it is outsourced direct) eventually, but in the meantime, I am feeling so much better. I don't have coverage for ND Healthcare, so it is out of pocket for me, and I am a single income earner in my own home, however, I have to say that it is totally reasonable for the benefit I have received! I paid $200 a month for 6 or 8 month for an injectable drug my GP prescribed me to help with some of the issues I was having which didn't work at all, and only made me feel sicker, and I learned it has a black diamond warning meaning in lab tests in rats it shows to give them thyroid cancer!!! It didn't even have human trials, I don't think-only rat trials! They told me not to worry because that warning is for high, long term sustained doses \ud83d\ude44 anyway, Dr. Muradov has helped me, and all by natural means! I am a big big fan of Dr. Muradov and his wonderful staff and clinic. I highly recommend.

He responded to my email regarding the refill - but I never got a call from the pharmacy that my prescription was filled - nor did I ever hear back from Dr. Muradov.
