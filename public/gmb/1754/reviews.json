You took the Sneak Peek test yesterday at 530pm and it takes some time to get to Sneak Peek's lab in California. You called us less than 24 hours later asking for an update and your sample was still in transit. As we mentioned on the phone Fedex did not pick up your sample last night and was picked up today. Our typical turn around time is 3 business days and express is processed the same day the lab receives it (one day sooner). We don't offer next day service for this reason as it is not physically possible. We outline this on our website and explained it when you came in. It is also stated on the waiver you signed.  Our customers love the convenience and flexibility of being able to take the Sneak Peek test after normal business hours while FedEx picks up the sample the following day. We also provide the tracking number to each of our customers so they can track their sample.","reply_update_time":"2022-03-01T23:40:08.701Z"},{"create_time":"2022-02-25T18:17:59.261Z","update_time":"2022-02-25T18:17:59.261Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnXXdPqf74VVVYKv0O_X8SD150GWAg12liY91Uae_I2YqTvqLfnQt2kiMRph02n064xEoRx","reviewer_display_name":"allison maraviglia","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxyP-aETQzKPwFS5l7xlAojS-_SrBDhG_8v3RFu=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thanks Allison!","reply_update_time":"2022-03-10T02:31:31.168Z"},{"create_time":"2022-02-25T02:22:21.012Z","update_time":"2022-02-25T02:22:21.012Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlgDXJ0TnCe6xBx4BhlZKlkecqAOFQX7QgYT2Nk-iLUlo3Qf-qdgsEhnsijdEcR3p5VAlVI","reviewer_display_name":"Miriam Delgado","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgtvK1K6P1YMmWQQny3uuRjEY4VTjmzLz7hH96Rfg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Had a pleasant time.

I have been a handful of times during both of my pregnancies I want to start by saying that the techs are always so kind and usually really try to get good views and photos of your baby. However my last two experiences have been disappointing. A few months ago when I went the tech said they were overbooked because a lot of people booked last minute. I waited an hour and a half past my appointment time before I was seen. I decided to let it go and chalk it up to a bad day. Today I got a text before my appointment that my tech was running late and my ultrasound didn\u2019t start until 30 minutes my appointment. I paid for a plus package and it was honestly a complete waste of money. The tech scanned for only 12 minutes which was super disappointing considering I had an upgraded package and only took pictures of one angle of the baby, and none of them are good. I\u2019m guessing she was rushing to get to the person after me since she was running late. I\u2019m really disappointed and won\u2019t be back, and I\u2019d recommend trying a different ultrasound studio.","rating":"TWO","review_reply":"Hello Breanne we are sorry you feel that way especially after having five ultrasounds with us previously. We did apologize for our technician running late due to the heavy snowfall today which caused an accident on our technician's way in. Unfortunately after scanning you for 15 minutes our tech was not able to see gender due to the position of the baby and free rescan was advised. Before your appointment you mentioned  that you had to pick up your child from school so you didn't have much time so we sent you the video recording of your ultrasound at no charge. Please let us know if there's anything else we can do and congratulations on the new addition!!","reply_update_time":"2022-02-24T23:54:48.395Z"},{"create_time":"2022-02-24T02:17:15.924Z","update_time":"2022-02-24T02:17:15.924Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlJveBsebFxu-Hc7hCSfaqaRTzp1m7ooCSJieay0oGuzIsRDuXcIqWK6sbNIBvj9_HSYZ_Gtg","reviewer_display_name":"Gina Ragucci","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gj5uXXYYmFJ9eU9fQJdP5KEdQlFBLlLn9qsqQhx=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thanks Gina!","reply_update_time":"2022-02-24T07:23:30.043Z"},{"create_time":"2022-02-20T02:34:14.529Z","update_time":"2022-02-20T02:34:14.529Z","review_id":"AbFvOqn5fGQbdyWDdCGENjDyzGPjIUYl5bEHMs7MkBKlZkmWPZINENRo6Y-EgSukeTSKbz8F2ECl-w","reviewer_display_name":"sasha diaz","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjwpSqXb9WLQZXmeOrgSHz-YWMgQsVJMqqraXSE=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Very nice decor.

You originally came in on the evening of March 15 and our technician said it looks like a boy but she was not able to confirm gender so she invited you back for a complimentary session. It appears this information was minunderstood and we apologize for that. You asked us to follow up with you to set up another appointment, which we did, and you came back on Tuesday March 19. At that time we did confirm it was girl. You were happy to have confirmation and sometimes we like to go the extra mile so we gave you a gender cannon. We do hope you have a happy and healthy pregnancy journey.","reply_update_time":"2019-04-04T21:20:44.564Z"},{"create_time":"2021-12-06T02:18:22.936Z","update_time":"2021-12-06T02:18:22.936Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlPV0fP-EgaZ_BKanreUUAz82JKWYOjcZEf5-x4mHubPC5ITNccvn3ZMg9zTlZ6hulIak_g-g","reviewer_display_name":"Jenna Naegele","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJx1Xoju2pDc09vqc-bU2qxsDAQtajS635xqC3De=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Really great experience.
