We strive to be an impartial liaison between Landlords and Tenants so that both sides are mutually benefited and protected. We believe we did just that. We applied the remaining funds to pay the HOA fines, which were assessed to the Tenant, as well as recovered the cost of a light fixture removed from the premises by the Tenant. We thought this was explained and understood but we are very sorry your perception was different and left you with a negative experience.","reply_update_time":"2022-01-14T22:00:22.447Z"},{"create_time":"2021-11-13T06:07:15.833Z","update_time":"2021-11-13T06:07:15.833Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkcPtIyvzPK0yHweYteCg6TDC8y3OsxrsunSCBc_H3P9DuUEv1eC-qbmB-GhpeOU0GiFEsTaQ","reviewer_display_name":"Melissa Brown","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GglCyna7yrElOXlubGUg4l8dvtCnd8zNSQSkCcaGw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Very friendly on the phone","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Melissa, Thank you for your nice review!","reply_update_time":"2022-02-24T19:51:54.247Z"},{"create_time":"2021-10-25T11:44:55.182Z","update_time":"2021-10-25T11:44:55.182Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkfHy3CE4pwCIQBFgfmp1z4xWRtfmnzjdVPnFTiwLN7j7RgJugtmPuRH_6yKgEn1SWZlFKO","reviewer_display_name":"Amelia Charlotte","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxCx6K63NnNRh33pk6zPnDmCxXdg4r0CM8kQuo6=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"The LB Hunt team is just amazing!
