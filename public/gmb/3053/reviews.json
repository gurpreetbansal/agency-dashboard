Absolutely no talent with filler, had my friend's cheeks laughably uneven. WILL NEVER GO BACK!","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"Mz Gainz,\nWe are very unhappy  we disappointed you. We use 3 very reputable companies for our website and social media. I have forwarded them your feedback since this is not the direct spas responsibilities. We do dilute our Botox the exact same with every patient and we follow only FDA guidelines on the packaging as recommended.  There could have been a chance you received a  bad bottle by Allergan. I am not sure. We would need to follow you up and try again. You can use one of 5 injectors if you do not like one providers techniques. We would love the chance to make this experience into a positive one. Please contact us and ask for Tina should you feel you would like to give us another try.","reply_update_time":"2022-07-03T17:15:01.214416Z"},{"create_time":"2022-06-10T21:17:39.114246Z","update_time":"2022-07-20T20:35:03.719266Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnuNfh3jzvAeC2jr2giE3EJ0o-A7ejtU83pI9yMmkTw_0sZY50dXtHc8TdZrCNPSuZfDumd","reviewer_display_name":"Kristi Nelson","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmkUjtpX7BZ8ilRLcGAJ7P4X49ccX6228eA9CGHH=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Kristi, Thank you for Leaving a 5 star review.

I have received botox regularly for the last 4 years. I was very hesitant to go anywhere else, however with that I felt that having a touch up would be fairly simple. Unfortunately I waited far beyond my appointment time, to receive a very rushed service.  The injectionist I saw was nice however I do not think was very thorough. She did tell me if I had any issues with how my botox was settling I could reach out and she would see me quickly. After about 8 days I notices that one side was still moving, possibly moving more than before. I called to be seen. The receptionist who uis less than polite told me that was \"normal\" for first time injections. I explained I was not new to botox and I also had never had issues prior she told me to call back after 14 days from my inital appointment. I called 2x and left messages. I called again and got through, to which i was told again it was \"normal\" i then said id feel more comfortablebeing seen and speaking ro the person who injected me. She put me on hold and came back to tell me i could come in 9am the next morning. I accepted it and unfortunately later that evening i was informed I would not be able to attend that appointment.  I called and left a message to reschedule that appointment for later that day. The next morning i called again and left another message. I then never recieved another call.Overall I felt like I was a burden to this business.\nI never recieved any follow ups.\nI would never recommend this medspa.\nI ended up going to another facility and had an assessment done.  To which it was determined that there was a major disruption in the symmetry of my face.\nI think that botox is a luxury service and as a paying client I deserve the courtesy of having my concerns addressed, especially since this is my face.\n.","rating":"TWO","review_reply":"Brittany,\nThank you for your comment.

Waited a week for the filler appointment, she didn\u2019t even know who I was, she never numbed me and straight up used the needle no cannula. Not only that, she used the full amount, not a little like she stated in my consultation. She over filled my left eye leaving a Tindel effect.
