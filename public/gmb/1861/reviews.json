Our daughter recently got married and we hired Goode Co not only for the wedding reception but for the Fiesta themed Rehearsal Dinner as well.  They cooked fajitas on site and they were delicious.  They had the most wonderful and fantastic guacamole bar ever!  The staff is very professional and so easy to work with! And as fabulous as the fajita dinner with all the 'fixins' was, the completely outdid themselves for the wedding reception dinner.  Cocktails and appetizers were served under an old oak tree.  The bacon-wrapped quail bites and the campechana were passed by the staff and were so delicious and very popular!   It was an outdoor ceremony at the family ranch and it was only fitting to serve beef tenderloin and grilled shrimp (Had to get the Gulf Coast flavor in there as well). They cooked the tenderloin on site which added the perfect touch to the ranch affair.  The food was served buffet style and the tenderloin was cut as each guest presented their plate.  And I have to quote one of my sons here--their Mac and cheese is LEGIT!!   If you can imagine making Mac and Cheese for 300 guests!!!  Let me tell you, it was the best I've ever tasted...Luckily there was some left over and we enjoyed it for the next several days!!  I can't say enough about the food---it was SO perfect, mouthwateringly delicious!!!  The staff is the best ever!!  Noura Zahra and April Zaharis put together an amazing weekend for us.   Their waitstaff and bar tenders worked tirelessly before, during and after the ceremony.  They set tables, passed appetizers during the cocktail hour, bussed tables, served wine, cut and served the cake, and cleaned and packed up all of the rental dishes\/glasses.   They were a godsend!  They were very professional and personable!  It was a joy to have them all.  Our guests were well taken care of and very well fed!!  Goode Co is amazing--the food, the staff..and did I mention the food!??    So easy to work with and they bring you the most amazing food-in taste and in presentation!  Thanks again Goode Co for making our wedding weekend perfect!!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-11-09T03:02:16.968Z","update_time":"2018-11-09T03:02:16.968Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnuyKqfm0MsQxu4SdqXc2XKKNMt508cXQv9j-nP0mtiKD2svoVCkiLlFiTN0ovYrdV7Z_DsEQ","reviewer_display_name":"\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627 \u0646","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjJsDc7SpXflvGF9jnCxzF4IyACgA3HXpQ5mWh0uQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-06-26T02:57:43.382Z","update_time":"2018-06-26T02:57:43.382Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmGzz-5gSPp16s8HEENG05_ShTlPFE45G6vxZjcNiUVRHbDzl5PXep_iKu99W9b4TCIaSq3","reviewer_display_name":"Gloria Vicente","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxOMKlt8_pjekoQL7FEPsVYp_JAFjpL9yc_8EXr=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"(Translated by Google) Super good excellent food\n\n(Original)\nSuper bueno exelente comida","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2017-08-27T18:51:46.256Z","update_time":"2017-08-27T18:51:46.256Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmF9uPWv3_9xSwhfz2glOc0CyPNfMzGkVyovt69JFogDYyLVFpRIB4Kfv3U8QjvxDt70S_cHA","reviewer_display_name":"jorge rodriguez","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Ghv3cUfowKWB8IH70Rkga5F9V7Uyv8DfV1qH8ec=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"...

I first want to go thru the food, it was delicious, It was probably the best brisket I have ever had from them.  The main thing I want to go thru is the efficiency of the team working the serving line.  They served almost 300 people in no time flat.  None of the meat was pre-sliced, they cut it as each person approached the buffet.  We also used their servers throughout the night and they did an excellent job.  As the night wound down, they started picking up the 300 votive candle holders off the table and boxing them, which saved me about and hours worth of work.  I cannot stress enough that this is one part of the night that went off without a flaw","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2016-09-19T16:40:25.314Z","update_time":"2016-09-19T16:40:25.314Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmohCjGRzw_b2ozyQ4Gsfwtv7_2zM-cXxAYlBbm5SEhXQP4trKfHAx9FzYK5wxv2nIXjTbERg","reviewer_display_name":"Firehouse Saloon","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GhUh-rguuod46lTL9Y6DyH59ECHrfkP_FllvJs_tA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Our clients for private events love the great barbecue and service!\n\nThe yummy desserts hit the spot!\n\nGoode Co. is a Texas landmark company  #texaspride","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""}]}
