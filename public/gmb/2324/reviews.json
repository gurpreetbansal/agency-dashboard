We were having issues and 2 previous companies spent about 15 minutes looking at the boiler and said the only option was a costly full boiler replacement. I decided to get a third and final quote from a smaller company like Pride just to verify and see if there was a price difference. Roger came out (within a few days of calling, other companies were weeks out) and spent nearly an hour diagnosing the boiler and how it was running. He even called the boiler manufacturer w the serial number to find out when it was made. Turns out the boiler is less than 10 years old! The other companies, without checking, said it was from the 80's, too old to repair and we needed a new one. After finding that out Roger did a full system run down: flush, new inlet valve and ordered a new aquastat which was the main problem. He was able to fit it into the very small space where the other companies said they couldn't. Not only did he make sure everything was functioning properly, but he came out the next day (at no extra charge)  because he was thinking the previous night he could actually make the system run better by adjusting the aquastat to a different mode. That is above and beyond in my book. I will definitely be calling Roger with Pride next time we have a plumbing issue.\n\nHe saved us upwards of $9,000.\n\nThank you!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Hi Luke, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

I had cleared out from under the sink and both shut offs were pretty easy to get to.\nI was taken back by the $300 they said it would cost to replace them, and that I was getting a deal because they normally charge $225 to replace one shut off.\nThe only reason I agreed was that the contractor that was replacing the bathroom counter was coming out the next day, and if I delayed having the shut offs replaced it would be almost two months before the contractor could get back out there. It took them about 30 minutes to replace both shut offs, excluding the time it took for them to go to the hardware store for the shut off valves.\nThe more I think about it, the more frustrated I am with myself for not just delaying the whole project, buying the tools and parts, and doing it myself.\nI gave three stars because the work was done correctly.","rating":"THREE","review_reply":"Thank you for choosing Pride Plumbing PHC, We appreciate your business and understand your frustration.

After speaking with Dana about my water heater issues\u2014the pilot light wouldn\u2019t stay lit\u2014the Pride technicians were at my door within an hour. Luke and David were prompt, courteous, and clearly knowledgeable about their trade. The parts needed to repair my water heater weren\u2019t available in town (13 yr old Richmond gas water heater), so I was quoted on a replacement. The installation was quick and the cleanup immaculate. 5 hours after my first contact with Pride I had a new water heater.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for your business!!","reply_update_time":"2021-07-24T18:39:12.803Z"}]}
