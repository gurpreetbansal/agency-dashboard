So far, this has also proven to be quite successful. We were very happy about the success of the therapy and would have given it a 5-star rating.\nHowever, we were also told at the time that telephone follow-up was a crucial part of the therapy. Therefore, she was to be called by her therapist every week at the beginning and later at somewhat longer intervals. Unfortunately, this telephone follow-up was discontinued by \"The Dawn\" a few weeks ago. Even after several inquiries we did not receive any explanation.  Although we have been promised again and again for about 3 weeks by the responsible Admission Manager that our inquiries would be forwarded to the responsible office and that a call back would be made from there, unfortunately such a call back has not yet been made. It is not possible to contact the responsible person directly, as we are not given any contact details and there is no reply from the ones we know.\nWe now consider the long-term success of the therapy to be in great danger. We have been strongly advised of the importance of the now prematurely discontinued telephone aftercare by \"The Dawn\".  We are now very disappointed about this.\nApparently they have problems with the Thai speaking team. At least there is a notice on the Thai language website that new Thai speaking patients cannot be accepted at this time. If this leads to the fact that already started and already paid therapies are simply discontinued without comment, this facility can of course no longer be recommended, despite initially great success.\nTherefore, for the time being, I have to give it a bad rating. However, should \"The Dawn\" find a solution, I will gladly change my rating again. Until then, unfortunately, only 2 stars.\n\nAddition: The problems could be solved in the meantime. I have therefore changed my initial rating to 4 stars.","rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"Dear Werner Siebert,\n\nMany thanks for your positive comments.

The Dawns overall approach is to enable us addicts to challenge our emotional beliefs and thought systems that produce feelings that drive us to drink and use.\nFrom the offset Ahmed was wonderfully clear and responsive taking me through in detail the process of entering Thailand during a pandemic. I was collected from the airport and entered The Dawn at my rock bottom having lost almost everything. I was truly powerless over my addiction and my life had become unmanageable.\nThe multiple discipline approach of working in a group and individual counselling setting, backed up with yoga, fitness and meditation works wonderfully for the body, mind and spirit. I have certainly connected with my higher power.\nThe support team especially Nick and Peng are always on hand and able to help talk me through a panic attack or any other thoughts, feelings and consequential behaviours.\nThe nursing team especially Ping Pong are wonderfully caring and balanced in their approach of regulating medication dispensing .\nI not longer think I am a terrible him being who deserves to be miserable for the rest of his (what would have been) a very short life. I have been able to test  thoughts, feelings and behaviours in a real life group setting and learn to challenge my thinking, leading to a fresh developed outcome, whilst no longer activating my long gone negative self beliefs.\nFor me this was a last change saloon scenario and thank god I found the Dawn. I am here currently and have been for three months.\nSuch is the tremendous work they do here I've experienced so many 'wow' moments, where I've realise how corrupt my thinking was and how cunning the addict within me can be.

They facilitated the travel and quarantine to Thailand as this was during the height of Covid and it couldn't have gone any smoother.\nOnce at The Dawn I was made very welcome and the facilities were brilliant. The gym is very modern with great PT's who are super friendly and push you. The food was AMAZING and I still miss it. The support staff were really friendly and approachable and SUPER helpful. The absolute highlight and reason for the 5 star review was the excellent councilling and group therapy sessions. They really helped me figure out the root causes of my mental health issues and drug and alcohol abuse problems. This was truly life saving and I cannot thank the whole team enough. Even now I am still doing aftercare sessions with the Dawn online which has been a huge help in transitioning back to everyday life.

Many of the reviews are FAKE.\n\nHaving suffered insomnia and mood issues for the most part of my teen and adult life, I chose to go to the Dawn. I had high hopes that were let down.\n\nTheir website advertises a 5 star treatment facility. This cannot be further from the truth! Much of their staff are recovered addicts some early as 6 months. Not what you would expect from \u201c5 star\u201d.\n\nSecondly 5 star say yes to reasonable request. I being PREGNANT yes, PREGNANT asked for 6 eggs to be eaten out of meal times\u2026.. The facility found my request not to reasonable and asked that I bring eggs from outside. This contradicts their statement of taking care of ALL your needs so patient can focus on recovery. A few days in, I had to arrange for 90 eggs to be brought from outside\u2026.. You would think paying $6k for 2 weeks 6.50 usd would not break their bank! Not to forget them price gouging prescription medication. I paid 300 percent more for medication.\n\nIf you are thinking of spending your life savings on this place, or putting money toward treatment, I as a REAL patient, advise you look at the alternatives.

But if she had carried on cutting they would of continued to treat her!\nWe were told about The Dawn, and contacted them. I spoke with Craig and explained the situation we were in and my daughter spoke with Craig and outlined her illness and addiction. We asked lots of questions and asked how long they felt she needed to go for and were advised for the best outcome the full programme of 3 months would give her the best chance. I was worried because sometimes my daughter would shut down and not be open to help but Craig reassured me that as long as \u201c the door\u201d was open even a crack they could get their foot in and help her.\nBecause of covid restrictions it proved quite difficult getting her out there, but The Dawn offer remote therapy via Skype, which proved invaluable, not only did it give my daughter a chance to meet her therapists, she began to see a light at the end of the tunnel.\nMy daughter left for the Dawn on 03\/01\/2021, she had to quarantine in Bangkok for 15 days, which was very daunting, as she does not cope well on her own, but the 24 hour support offered from the team at the Dawn was exceptional, she continued with group and individual therapy sessions, yoga classes and even Thai boxing classes. By the time she reached The Dawn she felt like she was meeting up with friends.\nShe\u2019s still at the beginning of this journey, but the difference I have seen in her so far is beyond anything I had even hoped for. Obviously she is not \u201ccured\u201d but for the first time she has hope. The support from the staff and her peers has actually made her begin to believe she can come out of the darkness and live the life she deserves.\nI can\u2019t thank Craig and the team enough for looking after her while she is so far away, and I am now very hopeful for her future.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Dear Caroline,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our services.

I was there for 7 weeks at the end of 2019\/ start of 2020 and had an extremely good treatment experience. Not only did my therapist really know his stuff - the whole team, including the fitness trainers and masseuses, were really supportive warm-hearted people. I still access their online aftercare sessions almost weekly as I find it helpful in managing my condition. To be fair, I do not know the details regarding these other cases, but after being in treatment at The Dawn for several weeks (and seeing therapists on and off for the last 10 years) I'd like to share my wisdom with anyone looking into treatment.\n\n1. Firstly, make sure the therapist is both clinically qualified to treat your particular condition and that they have handled similar cases before. One of my old therapists told me these days people can take a 6 week course and call themselves a therapist. My therapist had a masters degree which made me feel comfortable and able to trust him quicker.\n\n2. MORE IMPORTANTLY, if you truly want to get to get better (and we all can), YOU have to be willing to put in some HARD WORD and to trust your therapist and work together as a team. And once you feel better, the only way to maintain your recovery is to keep working at it - using the techniques you've learnt, like I am doing currently everyday, one day at a time.\n\nI was in a really dark place when I came to The Dawn and they worked really hard with me to see where my issues came from and what I could do about them. I'm forever grateful.  Good luck to all!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Dear Zara,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Dawn.

I attended in 2018 looking for mental health care after suffering the loss of my brother and father in quick succession. I had a traumatic childhood with significant emotional abuse which had been compounded by grief and trauma.\nThe Dawn had its issues - I found the food substandard and the kitchen sanitation poor. Not much was done to accommodate my restricted diet but equally I didn\u2019t make much of an issue of it either - I just ordered things I knew I could eat from the weekly shop. The therapy schedule was intensive and hard going, we were in groups from 7-7 with one day off doing activities a week. I was immediately put on the trauma track but also did work with those in the larger Dawn community who had issues with addiction etc. Having been an inpatient at private hospitals in the U.K. I feel the therapies, especially the group settings that were offered were comparable to those at the Priory in London. Some of the therapeutic staff were not as qualified as they could have been and there were definite safeguarding issues when it came to people being kicked out unfairly when the Dawn realised it was unable to help them with their issues, however for me it provided what I needed and I found the EMDR in particular extremely life changing when it came to coping with my fathers death. I think a lot of the success of my treatment hinged on the patients I found myself there with. We became very close very fast and it was a huge support to feel like I was amongst friends as I was addressing the issues I went there to deal with. Amazing support staff such as David Gale and Jared made the most difference, we became a community of sorts and I got the most benefit from the peer support sessions as opposed to those that were heavily structured or 1 on 1. (This was also my experience in London inpatient facilities where often seeing a psychiatrist was at an additional cost) I am aware that there have been a lot of staff changes since my stay which worries me as it was the staff who really made the difference between it being a helpful experience or not. Management definitely needs to take note of data protection - it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see other people\u2019s charts and documentation lying around offices during 1:1 sessions and they also need to have a much better system to really understand the issues patients are coming to them with. One person sadly died after being treated there the summer I was there and he should never have been accepted by the facility as they weren\u2019t equipped to help him in the condition he was in. Equally they kicked out a very vulnerable lady during my stay with no concern for her wellbeing after she left the facility and was essentially stranded at the airport for the night,  thousands of miles from home which caused huge distress for the rest of us left behind worrying about her and also left us worrying about the prospect of being kicked out ourselves if we were too \u201cdifficult\u201d. I know some people for whom the Dawn made the world of difference. I know some who found it no better than what they\u2019d have gained just spending a month away from the stresses of their normal lives and I know some for whom it was outright detrimental. I am aware that Tony Tan no longer works there which is concerning as he was one of the more highly qualified staff members. If they can tighten up the way they run the place and retain qualified staff for longer than they have been so far I can see how they could be considered an option when private mental health and addiction care isn\u2019t available in the U.K. and USA. However, I\u2019d not feel 100% comfortable recommending friends go there the way it is. Approach with caution and ask as many questions as you can about whether they are able to help with your issues before you commit if you are intending on seeking treatment as it\u2019s definitely not a one size fits all facility and while cheaper than equivalent in the U.K., it\u2019s still a large financial investment to make.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Dear Jennifer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Dawn.

She had experienced very similar trauma (with no cross diagnosis with addiction) to my own, which I had managed to make great progress with during my 10 day stay at The Dawn last year, thanks to excellent care I received back then.\n\nThe standard of care for trauma patients (with no cross diagnosis with addiction) has plummeted in the last year, and my friend was discharged half way through her stay in a much worse state than when she arrived. I have now withdrawn the testimonial video I made for their website.\n\nMy friend  made a reasonable request to be assigned to a female therapist, citing valid reasons for her preference and her request was met by an email not only refusing her request, but directly threatening her with both financial and emotional consequences as a result.\n\nShe then endured more than four days of isolation at The Dawn and was left entirely unattended by both therapists and management (only nursing staff checked on her). While this was happening the clock was ticking on her finances, and in the end she was discharged without any refund having suffered a significant setback.\n\nThroughout this time her patient confidentiality was breached, coercive methods were employed to unnecessarily detain her, and ethical guidelines were not followed either in the way she was treated or in the method employed to retain payments made by her.\n\nI can't comment on the treatment offered for problems with addiction, and this still appears to be the main area of business for The Dawn, but I would warn anyone suffering from trauma symptoms to stay well clear of this facility.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-07-21T13:44:16.210341Z","update_time":"2020-07-23T12:26:15.047458Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnwbBLQbXylyGguAnzYIV3dQ3K57gOJKlHnWqIzhXztC8Tad67UwPY3_JrxFdBvJBwuatrn","reviewer_display_name":"Alexandria Orlando","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmlEfRLZiHBJp7qM-EmW0ZWOJRe-qGXLHWCkCPM=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Reply from management under my post is more LIES and more lies!\nWe have all the proof.\nWe have emails and letter you want her to sign where you say she is discharge for \"program demands are not met\".\nCan post here and show your lies?\nshe did not leave, you throw her out because she asked for lady psychologist!!!!!\nWe do not need help from black heart people.

It was also not communicated that it would be 3 weeks before I would be allowed to leave. As a person with depression, I have spent years locked inside of my house (of my own doing) and found this to be very distressing. I was also bullied by another client and felt that the staff was not only slow to address this issue but was not prepared to do so.\nSeveral times during my stay during my stay, I expressed thoughts about suicide. These thoughts were not addressed. I was paired with a counsellor who I did not feel was a great fit. I had requested a meeting with the manager of the counsellors to express my concerns about my counsellor and about the bullying that I was experiencing but was not seen.\nIn the presence of three counsellors including one that I was unfamiliar with (which I found to be very intimidating), I was asked if I wanted to stay at the Dawn to which my reply was \u201cno\u201d and was I asked to leave that night without a plan for my safety.  I was also not refunded any money for the 5 days that I left treatment early. (Finances were not a big concern for me \u2013 but I know for some people reading this \u2013 they will be). I spent my last night in Thailand alone in a hotel room near the airport contemplating suicide. I left with the impression that I had failed in rehab felt and that I was incapable of being helped and that I was better off dead. This negative thought is still repeating in my head\nIn addition to the above feedback, the local staff were not trained professionals. Receiving massages, going to personal training and yoga with professionals who are not trained made my chronic pain worse.\nI chose this facility for its comprehensive care and because it was a much cheaper than its North American competitors however, the quality of care I received was not comprehensive.\nI also selected this facility because the reviews of the counsellors were also very good. However, I was not pleased with my own counsellor who had one particular method for treatment which I did not find effective (hypnosis).  I discovered that some of the reviews on Google and Facebook are written by the owners, their family members and the counsellors.  The website is much like any other website that is trying to sell you a product \u2013 the product or quality of the rooms, food, services or program are not as polished as the website. . I have worked in a counselling field myself and feel that this facility did not adhere to ethical standards for treatment.\nI would however, like to thank the local staff who showed a lot of empathy and compassion for the clients and offered simple words of encouragement and hugs. I suspect they are overworked and underpaid as many of them work 6 days a week. I would also like to acknowledge Dave G. who was apart of the support staff. He is a wonderfully kind and caring person with a tremendous amount of empathy for other people.  He is an excellent fit for working with people who are struggling with his endless patience and positivity.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-09-05T14:12:12.608132Z","update_time":"2018-09-05T14:12:12.608132Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmWbyH2bqDUqTLmfnCf-zgI9iCHdqGEvD2oFZRA7CPaSlZHwC2JJCyQBYIH-c34CIfu4dl8yA","reviewer_display_name":"Patient Client","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmmgLi9zMId7WutNJB8rsxYU4P8SmrMbp8lQ6ohx=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"A mixed experience. Several people thrown out for not finding the treatment helpful or making complaints about things like the poor food. Thrown out regardless of the significant difficulties they were dealing with and left without any support or refund. The amount paid was massive for some people in relation to income so this was a real financial as well as emotional loss for people who were already feeling desperate. The staff seemed to find it impossible to deal with the clients feeling that the place wasn\u2019t helpful or even feeling angry about how they were treated. So the response was to throw them out with the naive hope that that would make everything okay for others. It didn\u2019t- it made most people anxious and worried about whether they could trust the place. Very vulnerable people accessing this treatment- not the way to treat them. If staff cannot handle negative feelings (yes even ones directed towards them and the treatment) then there needs to be a much more thorough assessment of who they take. Not just take everyone and then throw them out when they feel like it\u2019s not working. The 5 minute phone assessment can not establish whether or not this is going to be helpful for different complex individuals demonstrated by 3 people being thrown out in as many weeks.\nThe medical care was also poor.\nHowever, the dawn was\/ is helpful for some- even life changing. And there will be some people who go there and it turns them round to a life with a future. But for others it may be damaging and this needs to be really looked at by those working there. If considering using this service, be aware that it may be helpful but it\u2019s not for everyone. This may be the same as other rehabs in Thailand as I have nothing to compare it to. Also, while not everyone is thrown out, everyone is pushed to stay longer and almost everyone is told they have trauma which requires more time in treatment (and more money paid to the dawn)...","rating":"TWO","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-08-28T14:18:59.601090Z","update_time":"2018-08-28T14:18:59.601090Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkCbjPWZTnmWCPWhur6ftimrURfS6Qn3PQq9YDbQXFlq4j2XbtKhv-WPpw4LA3JfICGJaSm_w","reviewer_display_name":"H","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucrQedDreFUk_wWFKiS3hDT_ByOYT2eMr19qWDG4yQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"After much concern and  detailed research of numerous facilities in Thailand  our son recently spent some time at The Dawn and it truly has been life changing.

There is an Inpatient Programme which is very beneficial as in my country,they only have outpatatient programmes.\nA major benefit of an inpatient programme is that you have medical and psycological support during the PTSD treatment which is essential for your safety and well being.There is also  EMDR which appears to approach psychological issues in an unusual way. It does not rely on talk therapy or medications. Instead, EMDR uses a patient's own rapid, rhythmic eye movements. These eye movements dampen the power of emotionally charged memories of past traumatic events and desensitize the emotions associated with the traumatic event.The uses of hypnosis in the psychotherapy of PTSD victims involve coupling access to the dissociated traumatic memories with positive restructuring of those memories. Hypnosis can be used to help patients face and bear a traumatic experience by embedding it in a new context, acknowledging helplessness during the event, and yet linking that experience with remoralizing memories as well as positive memories and a positive belief system.\n\nThe clinical team as well as the support workers made a huge difference in my rehabatilation as they gave me 100% percent support during this difficut time in my life and i am very greatful for my whole experince during my stay at the dawn.","rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-03-18T05:56:38.385Z","update_time":"2018-03-18T05:56:38.385Z","review_id":"AbFvOqks8YfakrwOWTGOLhkbD0gUmBWo76JSLFQgxUche4s4tgB_Qdi4nfMW-MxzQKCCD_qyqoJMpw","reviewer_display_name":"Samruay Ketruangroj","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmlGevQ8AZe-TAdcy8d3fi9nAtqBMK-s6x-gpkcD=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-03-11T14:51:29.384Z","update_time":"2018-03-11T14:51:29.384Z","review_id":"AbFvOql7YrZg_m9D9jBSd9hneCbpuGyI1pIQZUvzCgITCpEvMjnama5CeyyErknz4qNXOfMAuj-Hpg","reviewer_display_name":"shakti huilin","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmmMiAdQrOw7v0X3A55r4n7q3atx8F0Kjm6ukryB=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-03-08T02:33:44.403Z","update_time":"2018-03-08T02:33:44.403Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmUVNmGJ4GimMFQPn1K24JLs55apxUSoqOLJLV1YoPvf4QR9SBYOFSjj4AEEkBgYUaJN5TnlA","reviewer_display_name":"Julie Messenger","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmkguDR_QSQWj_2kygGYWIvYMnsuMApMe7ILGFw8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I was lost in Australia due to not being about to have intensive mental healthy care.

I have been in residence at The Dawn Rehab, and have had amazing results after several weeks.  I plan to extend my stay.  My private room and villa  are very comfortable.
