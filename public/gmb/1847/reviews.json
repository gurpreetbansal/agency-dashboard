We like to try each others stuff and all of it rated 5 stars.  The grand old fashion chicken tenders were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  The taquitos dorados were very tasty.  The bacon cheddar grits were delectable. A glass of sauvignon wine was enjoyed, a frozen margarita was consumed with gusto by me and my wife, our son enjoyed an old fashioned, one lemonade was sipped.  The yardbird was a hit.  Fried okra was everybody's fave.  Grilled chicken skewers were very good.  A couple orders of fried pork skins and cantina queso were annihilated.  Four butter biscuits were fought over.

Y\u2019all don\u2019t believe in biscuits down here?! Lol\n\nI ordered greens, rice and bean, and biscuits. Best decision I\u2019ve made this week. I\u2019m super picky about greens, but these are really good. The rice and beans has a good ratio, not Soupy. And these freaking biscuits! I would like to thank Heaven.. and the cook!\n\nI did to-go. Food was waiting for me (I was late and it was still nice and warm when I got home).  Man at the bar was nice enough. In and out in less than 3 mins.\n\nThis area, Upper has great food, but a lot of it is expensive and \u201cfancy.\u201d Which is fine. But sometimes you just want simple food done well and not to spend $40 on a single meal.\n\n$18 and I have 2-3 meals!
