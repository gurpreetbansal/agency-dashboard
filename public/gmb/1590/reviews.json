I initially felt bad for who ever got me because I know my teeth are in rough shape. Q made sure I was completely comfortable and helped me more then she will ever know. I left being able to smile more confident than ever. And a huge thank you to Dr. Marino for going out of his way to take 6 years of braces glue off of my teeth. Even though it doesn\u2019t seem like much, that little fix helped bring confidence back to my smile. It took 20 minutes to fix something that has bothered me for 6 years!

The staff is phenomenal and Dr. Marino makes sure that he tends to each patient, checking in multiple times per visit.  My very first experience with Marino Family Dentistry was due to a broken molar, which was cutting my mouth and would require a crown.  The practice where I was a patient wouldn't see me, they claimed they were closed at 2:30 p.m. I called multiple emergency dental offices that were booked.\n\nI called Dr. Marino's office on the advice of a friend, it was 4:40 pm.  He was walking out the door but stayed and waited for me. He smoothed the tooth out and a follow up appointment was made for the crown.  I just had my x-rays and cleaning.  By far the best dental cleaning experience I've had in 37 years.\n\nVisit Marino Family Dentistry, where you'll be treated like family and get superior service in a relaxing environment.  I have another appointment in a few weeks\n\nNo better way to spend the after noon than at the dentist.  Check out Marino Family Dentistry ya'll.  I'm relaxed and never been able to say that about the dentist.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for the very kind words Micah, it means a lot.

I could not be happier with the care I have been receiving.  If you are anxious or fearful they will put you at ease and you never need to feel embarrassed.  I am very thankful this practice is taking care of me.   It is so nice to visit a practice where the doctor and staff are happy.  Even Leo is ready to ease your fears.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-03-25T23:13:12.984Z","update_time":"2021-03-25T23:13:12.984Z","review_id":"AbFvOqk0yedk8QJlRye63RJnfDmJkE8DFRsujo_jjB23GgTRTdNrIBmptOlG7n2QXXkBHcyqvRq-zA","reviewer_display_name":"Eva Gray","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJx3u0HnxYc7FU8HNbLYR_a6OhzNFR_qJDmJwlcP=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-03-24T19:39:03.067Z","update_time":"2021-03-24T19:39:03.067Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnrjKDJM-5GcSAZYQDZa4rubrRK3R2KiJuFJKgrSc8v5KeuxO0qQVtneEKPIgXKBIvgYryW","reviewer_display_name":"Cosmic","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Ggg-fW3WDOeneAgxgslq_L6YVjW5zWQEYeYPV7bXw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-03-24T16:58:56.832Z","update_time":"2021-03-24T16:58:56.832Z","review_id":"AbFvOqm2_LZY5B6F9sIyvYsgFqxzp_z44y16-GkPrt_XDuvyKmtxil90tV2_7QNX6xd-qdX9IcE0cQ","reviewer_display_name":"Timothy Wilborne","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxtTXHje8_TNa_MpGmklvD1EJTw0JUhuLPRAv6-=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Friendly and professional","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""}]}
