Since then I've been lucky enough to find new dance families--first in Florida and then in GA. Now I've found my forever dance home. The community is maybe even the best part, but the caliber of classes offered in so many styles specifically for adults is refreshing. Motus truly supports every dancer at every level. There are classes for beginners to advanced\/professionals and everything in between. You can't help but feel better after dance for an hour...or several.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-10-29T20:14:19.438Z","update_time":"2021-10-29T20:14:19.438Z","review_id":"AbFvOql4GBwJ8ZxE5BaBIwm9c2zphODcJ125gKUKkOeLwibQYvibp73nzJh7o0JcnKE1Eet3FHxinw","reviewer_display_name":"Rachel L","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJyKZEt4E0PAH4uDCqTM8IQf44qoRg0tgL4OB_12=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Love this dance studio! I really love the vibe here.  I drive up to Alpharetta from the city to take class here when I can.

It is truly a safe place to learn and grow as a dancer (catering to all levels) and also offers yoga and other cross training and conditioning exercise classes to make for a well rounded studio experience.  With classes offered throughout the day (including evenings and Saturdays) it works with varying types of schedules.  I always feel welcome and comfortable to explore (even with new types of classes for me) and it\u2019s a fun way to exercise.  Going to classes brightens up my week for sure!  And the teachers are top notch.  Love this studio!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thanks for your kind words, Melissa! We love dancing with you and appreciate your friendship and support!
