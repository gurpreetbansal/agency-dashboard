He listened and advised me on the very best decision based on what i told him i wanted. He made me feel at ease throughout the whole process and i am so happy with my results. I had breast augmentation and choosing Dr Nassab was the best decision i ever made. I couldn\u2019t fault a single thing, from the consultation process, day of surgery and to the post op appointment. His secretary & the hospital team are also just as amazing and i couldn\u2019t thank them all enough. I have (& will continue) to recommend him to anyone wanting the same procedure.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-12-10T14:04:16.553Z","update_time":"2019-12-10T14:04:16.553Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnMF1Yv5nMNMYk7W4elAqJ6bl7o50Kfs76EvD2SNyd0biDRLT9-6p4zwCFnuPBvIx-_QWQV1Q","reviewer_display_name":"makeup angel","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJw7cJ678z2MYBAjz4zR2FdqzMxnQelAiEPtbzjZ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-07-09T22:36:10.318Z","update_time":"2019-07-09T22:36:10.318Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnVCwSXc08Kwb4e3lMKn2cDFs58F-5C-kbLzRirbgm1k9NZA_mgNrCmBbnDMWi_-kfTzaC-5w","reviewer_display_name":"pauline simpson","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjwTZqgFSQUaRA1G5E9pmQx-bFSvLxi9Krwyq3L=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Wow - why would you go anywhere else. I had a fantastic experience from consultation right through to aftercare. During the consultation I didn't feel rushed and really extremely well informed to support my decision making. I felt like I was the only patient that day which helped to calm my nerves and give me the confidence to know I had made the right decision. The hospital setting was fantastic, far far better than other private hospitals I have visited and the theatre and nursing staff were amazing, so chatty and friendly. The results speak for themselves, I had augmentation and at 47 years of age I am wearing dresses without a bra for the first time ever and I feel so much more confident with my appearance. Mr Nassab is a true credit to his profession, a kind a gentle man and an absolute treasure through and through. His results speak for themselves, I would urge anyone even considering surgery to seek a consultation with him. PS I must also mention his secretary Faye she is a superstar too!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-05-29T20:00:45.488Z","update_time":"2019-05-29T20:00:45.488Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnZBqK16QGWKAwwVuYZfZxGxGk2u17FyyMyiZaeeZnQRWvAIkuQd4S_cpIyvSZ2V8sxu3PQYQ","reviewer_display_name":"Stephanie6tg5pi Carradus","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJw-UtzmKalYNfvQGmn7C76BVXo9Q_eMURsMaVPL=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"After spending many years dreaming of having a breast augmentation, i finally plucked up the courage to go for a consultation in Wilmslow with Mr Nassab (in my mind,thinking it would never happen)\nHowever, the consultation was informative, professional and put me at ease straight away with his friendly and calming persona. The whole team at the Wilmslow hospital were absolutely faultless and considering i have never been under general anaesthetic before, i felt totally calm throughout the entire process. My results are fantastic and it has changed my life, i would highly recommend Mr Nassab to anyone considering a breast augmentation.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-01-07T12:52:57.497Z","update_time":"2019-01-07T12:52:57.497Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmplWEv_XViXaiUURUqrAH7ILeThXMAitKOUXOdhP22lFawvHMH6UVDB03eQhJG2aPVG1GGtQ","reviewer_display_name":"Annabel McGuire","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJyLxXnc4ExCWEguPJDC_Pmi4MzXWNdbasOEX_P8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Mr Reza Nassab is the most excellent surgeon, he made me feel at ease through the whole process and was happy to answer all my questions however silly they might of seemed.
