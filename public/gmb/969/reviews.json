The receptionists were great. And then Andrea took pictures of my sons teeth\/mouth. She was awesome! My son is very high energy and distractable, but she kept him on track and he actually had a lot of fun with it!\n\nThen, Brandy came and got us and helped us understand and walked through the process of getting braces. She was amazing as well!  We left her office with a great understanding of the process and my mind was at ease. My son is very into rubics cubes and when we met the Dr, he showed interest in the rubics cubes, and it really made my son happy. Then we got a shirt and ice cream for my son! He is so excited to be getting his braces from HI 5. If I could give the place more that 5 stars I would. Everyone there is positive and you don't feel like you are just a number in the patient logs. You know they're there for you!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Wow!! Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! This is amazing, we love seeing these reviews!

My consultation was so informative and the treatment coordinator listened to what I wanted for treatment. I am getting married in September so I am on a tight budget and they worked with me on my payments and due date. I started Invisalign same day and I am loving it. I am able to track my wear time and what trays I am on through the Invisalign app and send progress photos to Dr. Williams. It\u2019s the best thing ever!
