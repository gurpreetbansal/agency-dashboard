We know following the feedback of hundreds of students every year that our teachers always make every effort to treat each student with an equal respect and support.\n\nWhilst we will always accept feedback in good faith as a vital way for us to improve, we must state that in this case we are concerned as to the nature of your complaint.  It is unacceptable to form an opinion of a teacher, their ability and their attitudes based on the colour of their skin. It is for this reason that we are unable to offer you an alternative class.\n\nShould you wish to pursue this further, we have emailed you our Complaints Procedure showing you how to do so.","reply_update_time":"2021-10-12T09:38:10.099685Z"},{"create_time":"2021-09-11T23:50:47.692363Z","update_time":"2021-09-11T23:50:47.692363Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmTozHQuSMBesjqkBhztDVURVLykRsfUSnufwnh59Pj20qN1C9mEWaB8zfDEDiFxzV-Os7OoQ","reviewer_display_name":"Raphael","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmkvrDN4lcOwYakbHwYYkBsBvPEQDhRkcsHt8IrF=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Very good experience, first course  at  Elatt and I hope more to come.\nVery good communication, my teacher was patient, expert and friendly!\nSubrata really made the effort to include everybody and answer all our questions.

My favourite one was the one we did with Laura from London Wildlife Trust at the Walthamstow Wetlands. We learned a lot about nature and helped to do some work around the garden. I also really enjoyed doing a film about homelessness with Emilia from Odd Eyes Theatre, and taking pictures of the community is with Lucy from Headliners.\n\nI have been studying Business IT and have just finished my level 2.

It does happen that from time to time that we are unable to run a particular course (for example, if there aren't enough other students to run a particular course at a given time, perhaps evening or daytimes, that a certain student can attend), and when that happens, we will offer the student an alternative course instead, usually the course that the applicant stated would be their second choice. We're sorry to hear on this occasion that we couldn't offer you an alternative course that you wanted.\n\nWe must clarify though that all our courses are free: the only students who we have charged fees to in the last five years are adults over 24 taking a Level 3 course, where the government requires them to take a student loan called an FE Loan. We have not run any courses since 2014 where a student would need to pay in cash at all. If you think this is not the case for you, please get in touch through our website and we'll be happy to look into it.","reply_update_time":"2021-06-22T22:02:12.670014Z"},{"create_time":"2019-11-26T19:32:40.987438Z","update_time":"2021-06-22T14:35:00.986658Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkG838hrEqd4_O8D6qLr298VwHrjN4eEK729WcIH9iLt_7nIHZhTLYG7z23G96zxsaaRXTKvA","reviewer_display_name":"Thaygla Rhaitza","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucr4MnuBUu8dj09m3XEf5UW2yqpTdH7Z5Q3OCkCOAw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Being a Elatt student was the best thing that happened in my life since I first came to London. The support provided, the kindness and respect from teachers and staff made me feel belonging again. I have learnt so much.

Our lovely teachers provided much more than ESOL classes, they gave us daily hope, guidance to still planning our future and don't give up about our goals. I got my first job later on. I got confidence to speak and write in English. However I got an deep gratitude to this organisation that could never be measured by this simple review.

The teachers are friendly towards SEN students like me and are always a pleasure to have around!\n\nBut in March 2020, London was put on lockdown, meaning we couldn't go to ELATT in person. That meant every lesson had to be online. However, there were a few problems. Firstly, my tech lessons required a Windows PC, but the only laptop I had was a Chromebook, so I wasn't able to perform basic Windows tasks, such as Disk Cleanup or typing basic commands in Command Prompt.\n\nI did get a new laptop, but on the first day, it seized up. Nothing was responding, the Start menu was crashing on it, and I couldn't access the Defrag program. It wouldn't even run Webex and Edmodo at the same time, so I had to do most of my Webex sessions on my phone!\n\nIn June 2020, I decided enough was enough. I asked for ELATT to give me a laptop on loan, but never got it in time. I asked my family members if they had a laptop I could use - thankfully someone did! I upgraded it with an SSD and new RAM sticks for optimum performance.\n\nI hope to come back in person this term!","rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"Thank you so much Alfie for your review and we're glad you were able to keep studying throughout lockdown!","reply_update_time":"2020-12-22T12:20:56.526369Z"},{"create_time":"2020-07-24T13:33:55.665673Z","update_time":"2020-07-24T13:33:55.665673Z","review_id":"AbFvOqleDlmQNoFu1W-uq0umXt8hBy0DCokzvblCXR7jbaCZIg0OKm7xvTDpRpUuA2O14swsBzcB8w","reviewer_display_name":"Adnan Tanmoy","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucr3Zd51K-vjyS89z0vQ29AMDKjwbAj50apTZfotsA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Lockdown review my own experience\n\nI writing this review to talk about my experience studying at ELATT during lockdown.\n\nLockdown has been very difficult for me but everyone at ELATT has been wonderful and very supportive. This applies to the admin staff, the technical team, the TAs and the teachers.\n\nSince lockdown I have been able to continue my studies in a whole new way and still carry on in order to get my qualification sorted and ready to take a next leap of my career. I have been having regular timetabled online sessions every week. The teachers teach as if we are in a real classroom. I was really worried about how I was going to continue my studies. Although it is not as good as being in a classroom it is still very good.\n\nI haven\u2019t liked lockdown because I wasn\u2019t allowed to meet my friends or go to any other people\u2019s household which made it boring for me. But because of my online lessons during lockdown I have managed to socialise with my friends at ELATT as we are all in a meeting together. This has been very good for my well being.\n\nIn addition to our normal lessons, ELATT gave us the opportunity to work on online projects with London Wildlife Trust and Headliners. I have to thank Laura from London Wildlife Project for teaching us about the environment and for letting me write a blog. I also have to thank Lucy and Zahrah from Headliners for helping us create podcasts and learn about journalism. We finished the year by going on a Wildlife Action Day to Woodberry wetlands where we learnt about wildlife conservation. It was really good to get out and meet my friends again and also to see the swans and other birds.\n\nI want to finish by saying that although lockdown hasn\u2019t been the best experience for me, ELATT has helped me so much to continue my studies and to help with my mental well being.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for this wonderful review Adnan and all the effort and commitment you have put into your studies!","reply_update_time":"2020-12-22T12:21:32.069196Z"},{"create_time":"2020-07-07T07:33:45.872114Z","update_time":"2020-07-07T07:33:45.872114Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkISO4dYFufkqyEswAFyi1S9xUmGVTklPnWKRN6vO9JNZwvmuBS8vvEJjOOZpp23ad1oPaemQ","reviewer_display_name":"Desislava Sued","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucqbH9xVw1MATyN1sBsnLiHqfrFtZP7_Nw15z2LLNA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-06-30T22:17:02.539723Z","update_time":"2020-06-30T22:17:02.539723Z","review_id":"AbFvOqn0y_J4TxSfGP7ADnogndGh73m4AU7J4GxUVZpVaQT_eSNrJl70IBLYXO6JUQ0SdYbkiYO0OQ","reviewer_display_name":"Mel Dincer","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucpuG8VCsyjnntYnK9Nqp9TPUqv8HAC-m4rdH6ew=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-06-29T13:50:59.552958Z","update_time":"2020-06-29T13:50:59.552958Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmGarJeAYLiIXutYjaDFPw-GmOr8RnlHzRrzCMfvqGc3wUJYo6F-1FQFie4hn7aMWhg09FqYg","reviewer_display_name":"Shohel Ahmed","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmmnjBGSEQhZHw2suV4hmTXuxzUD9isQV0ZE4jEKQw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"My experience with elatt isn\u2019t great at all I understand we under the pandemic that should be a lot easier to give support from home via video call but no support I lost all respect for this agency I have email the teacher and spoke to the receptionist to send me the work sheets by email but they chose to ignore me.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"Hi SA,\n\nWe're extremely sorry to hear that your experience with ELATT was not as expected.\n\nWith the introduction of the pandemic, we've been working hard to strategise and adapt from providing a classroom-based training experience to an online-based one.
