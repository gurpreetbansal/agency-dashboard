From the first visit where Lewis showed us around the venue to leaving the morning after our wedding, the venue and staff were perfect the entire time. Abi and Lewis were always on hand in the run up to the wedding to answer any questions we had, they were so flexible in tailoring the winter wedding package to us and we always felt so reassured and secure in their expert hands. We met with Abi for our pre wedding consultation and she was just incredible, nothing felt like too much trouble, she offered us great advice and reassurance and is clearly very talented at what she does.\nOn the day, the service staff were fantastic, lots of our guests have commented on how amazing they were and that they are the best venue staff they've come across. The food is absolutely to die for and it was brilliant to able to give our guests so much choice and to know each course was going to be absolutely delicious.\nMy husband and his party really appreciated the drinks to settle their nerves on arrival too!\nWe want to thank all the staff involved in the fantastic running of DeCourceys and can't recommend the venue enough.

Get it right and you\u2019re in heaven - get it wrong, and it becomes a living nightmare. You need to ask yourselves, \u201cwhat do you want from your wedding day?\u201d This is a question we asked ourselves repeatedly and the answer stayed the same. We wanted to get married in a lovely venue and for everyone to have an amazing time. We visited 6 of the best venues South Wales has to offer but in the end we chose Decourceys Manor. We weren\u2019t disappointed! Lewis & the Staff really do go above and beyond to make your day exactly as you want it and as special as it can be. You\u2019re not simply dealing with a business who wants your money, you\u2019re dealing with a family that care. So let\u2019s break it down;\n\nThe Venue - you\u2019re guaranteed complete exclusivity for your wedding with lovely surroundings (indoors and out) that will help capture beautiful moments.\n\nThe food - I cant overestimate how good the food is! All I can say is, our guests couldn\u2019t stop complementing how amazing the canap\u00e9s were before the main breakfast..! We\u2019ve never been to a wedding before where everyone was loosing their minds over the canap\u00e9s! That\u2019s how good the food was and the mains were even better.\n\nThe layout - Decourceys Manor is quite deceptive. If you can imagine it, I truly believe Decourceys can recreate it! To give you an example, at night when people were enjoying their buffet, they were all in total disbelief when they realised that they were in the same room that we took our vows in. Such is the transformation that the team at Decourceys can achieve. It really did take friends and family a few minutes to believe it was the same room! Then the next morning whilst having a lovely cooked breakfast, the venue was already preparing for another wedding. It was the complete opposite to what we had and really just showed how versatile and what the Decourceys team can achieve. Same venue but looked like two different places.\n\nPrice - the good news is Decourceys is not the most expensive! But to be honest, there wasn\u2019t much in it. Hundreds rather than thousands between venues with what we wanted with numbers etc. However some venues did bump up their price by thousands if you wanted complete exclusivity whereas that\u2019s standard with Decourceys.\n\nAt the end of the day, what do you want from your wedding day? IF your wedding is about feeling special, being special and having an amazing time. Then accept no substitute. DeCourceys Manor is definitely for you!\n\nAll the staff were amazing but we have to finish with a special mention to Lewis & Nicola.
