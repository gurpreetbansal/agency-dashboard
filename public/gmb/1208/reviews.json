We take very important clinical measures to ensure that a patient has a normal delivery rather than a CS. Nobody here wants a CS to earn extra money, and we try and prevent this as much as possible by encouraging patients to start their prenatal journey with us as early as possible. We can then assess patients and start them off in the right manner so that a CS is avoided as much as possible. Of course, that does not guarantee that a CS won't happen due to complications in the labour stage, to ensure that mother and baby are safe. But chances are much lower than if a patient comes in just for delivery without us having any records of her medical and maternity journey (eg - does the patient have a history of high blood pressure, previous CS, how has her pregnancy progressed to date etc).\nPatients are encouraged to start their pregnancy journey as soon as possible in order to have a well-managed pregnancy, with the hopes of a normal delivery at the end, and a healthy mum and baby. This is what motivates us, not the money!","reply_update_time":"2021-05-26T05:14:12.893384Z"},{"create_time":"2021-05-12T23:41:58.098973Z","update_time":"2021-05-12T23:41:58.098973Z","review_id":"AbFvOqllKGGTq9IOC1NmVc4ovDRq-Pgxq3z98wVFJ8CcKHgDBUs_6I8Iwe0hH_sfH2Ewi-N_jmOv","reviewer_display_name":"loise maua","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AFdZucof2AdAV43RuMOL5ni6OdGMVf2puS0alfkHHciMngA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thanks so much for your review Loise!
