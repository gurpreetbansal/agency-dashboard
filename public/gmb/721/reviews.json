The old roof was cedar shake that was nearing, if not at the end of its designed lifespan. We had multiple roof quotes done by various companies for different types of products. At the end of the day Luke from Country Towne stood out from the rest as he was on time, answered all our questions and explained the process. Luke is very personable, genuine and easy to talk with. He is very experienced and knowledgeable with his products. The job took 5 full days to complete and the finished product exceeded our expectations. The crews were on site at sunrise every morning ready to go. At the end of every day they cleaned up the site leaving no unsightly mess or dangers (I have young children). Country Towne attention to detail was second to none and I would not hesitate to recommend them for your roof. We are very impressed with their craftsmanship we would like to have them back for eavestrough and soffit.
