I have suffered for the last 8 years (I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was told I would never recover and I would only get sicker) and had started to rapidly deteriorate in the last 2 years. My cognitive function was getting to be at an all-time low and was on the verge of dropping out of university and closing my energy healing practice.\n\nI was on a video call with my uncle and I couldn\u2019t help but be very distracted by how I looked during the call. I couldn\u2019t believe it was me. I thought, \u201cthis MUST be the camera. I definitely don\u2019t look that bad\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the call, I took a photo. I actually looked that bad. While I felt horrible, I didn\u2019t realize how significantly it was starting to show. This prompted me once again to look outside the scope of western medicine for a solution. My regular doctor has tried everything he can within the system that he can work in. He felt powerless watching me deteriorate so quickly. Anyway, after some research I found myself on the TruMed website looking at the available IV treatments.\n\nBased on what I know about the progression of my illness I knew I had to call and book in ASAP. They fit me in right away. I have to thank both Jackie and Dr. Muradov for fitting me in so quickly. They have no idea how it completely altered my life that week.\n\nI took the photo on a Sunday. I was in for my first treatment on the following Thursday. On Friday morning I got up and had a shower and looked in the mirror. I was very surprised. I couldn\u2019t believe the difference in my face. At first I thought, \u201cOh this is just that thing where you think you look ok - good even and then you take a selfie and you\u2019re like \u2018OMG NO, I do NOT look as good as I thought\u2019\u201d So, I decided to get into the natural light and take a picture.\n\nI could not believe it. I looked 15 years younger. I felt better than I had in ages! I saw my dr the next day on Saturday and he was giddy when he saw the difference from the week before. He couldn\u2019t believe it either!\n\nNow, my doctor sees me a couple of days after each treatment. He wants to monitor this closely. He is very excited at my progress in only a few weeks. I am so grateful for the thoughtful care I receive at TruMed and as much as I continue to temper my hope, I am often overcome with emotion when I think of how far I have come in three weeks. I went from failing four out of five classes to an average GPA this semester of 3.1 - all improvements made in my last week of classes with assignments and my final exams the week after. Having access to my brain again and seeing improvements every day in my ability to problem solve, short term memory and being able to commit things to long term memory, logic and reason, emotion regulation, to name a few - and being able to be hungry and EAT and feel thirst again has been amazing \ud83d\udc95 Thanks again Dr. Muradov and the awesome staff there for helping me to change my life. I have hope that I will be healthy again!\n\nHere are three photos I took (I am 46 years old) - the first three days before my first treatment, the second was the morning after my first treatment, and the third was the evening after my second treatment a week later. This span between these photos is 14 days. No makeup applied or filters on the camera. All were from my selfie camera on my cellphone.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-12-22T00:32:38.975Z","update_time":"2020-12-22T00:32:38.975Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnTwH5pqNnRQKpqXhnDUDCwIF8-6q6AB1sFKthpbHimNoHSAvEqQCc0CCkoIcAKWUOQleIy4g","reviewer_display_name":"E Hofmann","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GifhwW6nbjvtFF9ynUWz4HDbN2MOJemrmIMqKxL67g=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Highly recommend the services of Dr. Muradov!

I really appreciate that Dr. Muradov takes the time to really listen to you and doesn't dismiss your symptoms and concerns as I have found with other doctors in the past. He is very kind and respectful, and for the first time in 6 years I feel well after following his recommended treatment plan. For anyone suffering with thyroid related issues I would go and see Dr. Muradov, he is an excellent Dr!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-05-25T04:51:41.279Z","update_time":"2018-05-25T04:51:41.279Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkidoMQVYvNRZx0HW_niCy1M8gQSMsEzfxW3FdwZZzb2k5LU2ze0BZxwbOH5yKOhS_t2zz1TQ","reviewer_display_name":"Emilie Bourbeau","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gjc--2Kv5TcEbg6JEgRoJmONtZbQ93Pn2r2OdiO8A=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Amazing and friendly! I was not doing good mentally and physically for the last several months. I booked an appointment with Dr. Eric and explained my situation. He took time to listen to me. He shared his knowledge and expertise with me. He explained everything that he will be doing to try to solve my health issues. It has been over 4 months now and I can finally enjoy life again. I am truly thankful. I followed his plan and today I am here to share with you what Dr. Eric has done for me. I also have to add that the front staff is Amazing! Always making you feel welcome and at ease.
