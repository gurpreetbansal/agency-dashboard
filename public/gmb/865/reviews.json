It's so fresh; the finish is really clean. Now, I buy a variety of oils and change it up everytime. I'm addicted!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you for sharing Joanne.

I always look for them at the weekend markets on the mainland. I especially like their ghost chilli and scorpion chilli oils. I use it for breads and cooking. Really good quality oils on offer. I'll definitely try to find them again next month","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-06-13T15:22:47.131Z","update_time":"2018-06-13T15:22:47.131Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkkEmn9tgaN8vWapa8yzpCDISvjgRkQFFRWQjGMcILeTD2P-IDuOpZSFEputYW7zBA8bc_S","reviewer_display_name":"Dave - Oh My Print","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgL9wOG9WoaCuc0k6_ZXh8B9bkzc4CJYEWAZ0nC-Q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I have to say these cold pressed oils are incredible. I can really taste the difference. I picked up a bottle from a farmers market and thought ok, it's nice quality oil, and then upon trying it, it went beyond my expectations. I am excited to try more flavours!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""}]}
