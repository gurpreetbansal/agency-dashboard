I'm a NQT. I finished my degree last summer and I registered with three agencies in London. Two of them only gave work as a TA - they said I needed more experience before I could work as a teacher. However most of the time they sent me to SEN schools, which were lovely but would not help me to earn more experience as a mainstream primary school teacher.\n\nThen I registered with Impact. The process took about two weeks while they checked my references. Once they that, they sent me to work as a teacher straight away.\n\nI did daily supply and short-term supply for about two months. Afterwards, I told the agency I felt ready for a long-time assignment. The next week they sent me a contract for three weeks; by the end of the third week, the school was so happy with me that they asked me to stay with them until the summer.\n\nEven though next year I hope to be hired directly by a school so I can do my induction year, singing in with Impact Teachers in one of the best decisions I have ever made. They have helped a lot. Every time I had a doubt or I was lacking confidence, I would call them and they would explain anything to me very kindly. Unlike other agencies, I feel they are honestly invested on making your life easier.\n\nI\u2019m very thankful for everything they have done for me, and I could not recommend them more.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-08-09T19:09:22.040Z","update_time":"2018-08-09T19:12:59.449Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkiua4LViIG9JbQfiL6krFCGkK7Azuyb5PkaB1AZ3d09sCJwCSN2HMOp-QbyKopAGEhF6pF","reviewer_display_name":"Catie Ash","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmnISBj0GDaQTZEoo1iSbwrOG1rBn5D6gKmIfopV=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Please AVOID Impact along with virtually all teaching agencies. The UK is absolutely desperate for teachers in the state school (non private) system, trust me, apply directly to schools. This agency spent a whole year taking a truly absurd cut of my paycheque (how much, of course, I'll never know - they go to great lengths to hide what you would be making if you actually worked for the school instead of \"through\" them). Like most teaching agencies, they do very VERY little - enough to justify taking a cut in the first month of your pay, maybe. Instead, they collect thousands of dollars all year long. I made less than my colleagues all year, and please be aware that Impact will not (\"cannot\") actually pay you either. Oh no. They make you register with a PAYROLL COMPANY! These firms should be utterly illegal and probably will be soon. It's yet another third party profiting off your hard work. Basically, you work all day (often in an appalling school, because the state of education in the UK is generally shocking - especially in terms of behaviour). You earn in the region of $200. Impact takes a huge cut. The payroll company takes a moderate cut (for NOTHING - they are simply giving you what you earned! lol). Taxes come off. Additional taxes from your home country might come off too (don't forget that part). A forced pension that you can't possibly get back (unless maybe you live in the UK when you retire, decades from now) comes off too, thanks to the payroll company's insistence. At the end of the day, beaten and broken by the UK's education system, you take home what's left - i.e., in the region of half. HALF of what you deserve\/would earn if you were actually employed by the school. Please please please I beg you, do not make my mistake. Get hired by schools directly. Research and apply to schools directly. Don't go through agencies. Ever. They never help you enough to be worth what they take ALL YEAR off your pay. I'm currently fighting tooth and nail to get the bonus I was promised for sticking out this terrible year, and I can't even find one person at Impact I dealt with in the past. The turnover at this organisation is that high. No one responded to my emails, no one contacted me, nothing. It's all for me to figure out and fight for. If I ever get that measly bonus (\u00a3250 for lasting a whole year), I may consider changing this review. But really, everything in it is entirely honest so I don't see why I should. I want to see others forewarned... p.s. as with most companies these days, they definitely have no problem posting fake reviews so please don't see any of these positive ones as reliable. Ask yourself: why would someone lie about the negative aspects? Answer: no reason at all. Just advice from an experienced teacher for those vulnerable souls that companies like Impact seek out and prey on. p.p.s. a tip for companies writing fake reviews: don't overuse the same phrases, it's a dead giveaway (\"extremely helpful\" comes up for Impact a few too many times to seem legit).","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-08-08T09:50:56.052Z","update_time":"2018-08-08T09:50:56.052Z","review_id":"AbFvOqm8LNE9pc1DSxIn4jBmkW3X5DKsoJ6P58FUmUcvt0175cfscJUoOG9f48S1xYDxga2bKwm0","reviewer_display_name":"Alexandra Jinks","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmk9Z1UA4_qJUxMyf_flkejIQpPsRzq6_zxR-rxC=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Extremely professional and helpful.
