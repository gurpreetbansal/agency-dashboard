Had to put 'non-refundable' deposit down.

Hello?  They are 'consultants'...\nDemanded another $8K!! Or they keep the deposit?!\nDodgy.  BTW, their stuff is made in China, not in AU as they make you think.  Worst consumer experience.

Over the intervening years I have investigated various wrought iron manufacturers and for the most part they have been far too expensive.

The design people are fantastic, the workmanship superb, the installation very well done & the price most competitive.

From a very informative website to a well stocked showroom, helpful customer service, reasonable prices (for what you actually get!) and after the expected three month build wait, professional and neat installation services.  We are absolutely thrilled with our new entry door and have nothing but praise for the people from UWI who were helpful throughout the process.  In comparison with a new timber door with inferior styling and door furniture and locks extra, the price for these wrought iron doors  represents excellent value.  Highly recommended.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2018-05-30T04:54:19.093Z","update_time":"2018-05-30T04:54:19.093Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmqqCPrAJXZpQgVyIIaOtszFqSJVJfQ27lQY9aczZuUODzjhGJTrQnWFKxKuJEBYmU4jaQm","reviewer_display_name":"Dave Short","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmntaJfd8IA0gxFynnqc4fmuUeuMyh72XY5KqXv1=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Unique Wrought Iron supplied install installed doors on our new house and we are so happy with the results.
