When Jamie came over and expected the issue he assured me that my wife and I would not need to spend that much and that he could fix the problem for a reasonable cost... that's exactly what he did.\n\nFrom start to finish he explained to me what he was doing and why he was doing it and as a first time home owner I thought this was incredibly helpful and kind. He also laid out for me multiple scenarios and encouraged me to do what was best for my wife and I. I hate it when people press the sales button and try to make people go all out when it isn't really necessary... Jamie was not that way at all.\n\n100% recommend Jamie and Remedy Plumbing.
