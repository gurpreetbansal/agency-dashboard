Instead, he came out more screwed up than ever, and with a side chick, enabler addict named Randi, and a prescription drug dealer named Ron. This isn\u2019t an angry rant from a disgruntled partner. I am legit warning people about trusting that their loved ones will actually get the help they need from this establishment. It\u2019s filled with people who don\u2019t actually want to get better, or be any kind of real support for others in the program. It\u2019s pretty much a meetup for addicts to connect and relapse together. This is not a safe place for those who want to take it seriously.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-09-07T07:33:18.737Z","update_time":"2020-09-07T07:33:18.737Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlfzN-mdH1ZhJjORcyGKmMrcijjsZtKjmN1tzhRfNOp5GHZa2QrEQ5SHwuqvJbuoKdJkd9qaQ","reviewer_display_name":"Lynn Busby","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjPosIbflNxOAdHlInQKDOUROXF63htTQ8fCF7q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-07-24T17:31:38.546Z","update_time":"2020-07-24T17:31:38.546Z","review_id":"AbFvOqm_Q5lErY5jyvZFOxyVSvc9vmIRU6FieAVrimh4EzPcK-1lbAP4bYaTLKwGyvPgcQ8QQ_VWlQ","reviewer_display_name":"Emiley McEwen","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxP9nwUWoUh17-AaV0Dqb6ScAbsKCtqysTaSBxo=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great Staff, Great experience!

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.  They've billed my insurance company multiple times trying to work out there daily fee.  They kept submitting until they got it right.  Over 30,000 submitted so they could finally get me a bill for what I supposedly owe after post insurance write-offs and this is after the required substantial deposit.  They took over 5 months to get me a correct bill and now threaten collections.  I would of paid if the bills wouldn't of varied so greatly month to month.
