Only to find lackluster bland designs and awful customer service with their main focus only being on bridal fashion and outdated men\u2019s designs.\n\nAfter my first consultation at Sherwani King, I was incredibly impressed with Ejaaz\u2019s eye for detail and knowledge of men's wedding attire, all complimented by the unique sherwani pieces and accessories they have.\n\nI would heavily recommend all grooms to visit Sherwani King for a bespoke consultation as I believe there is currently nothing like this that exists in the men\u2019s Asian wedding scene when it comes to attire.\n\nYou have a wide a range of choices, 1:1 sessions (unlike the shops mentioned above), Complete control of creative direction with the pieces, fast turnover on the outfits and accessories, one stop shop for accessories as well which saves times shopping in multiple places i.e. shoes, ceremonial sword, necklaces etc. Even when it came to some slight measurement changes, Ejaaz was more than accommodating in resizing the pieces to match the new measurements. Also you a constant line of communication to ask any questions directly, you are not left in the dark.\n\nRaj","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2022-07-12T03:50:02.788521Z","update_time":"2022-07-12T03:50:02.788521Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlNlgquE8shOszcKD8KVmRtIT_QAdOs1nEHOjxey8S78FBFm6KcgrealHxaOR-O08jIPbDb9g","reviewer_display_name":"Vikesh Patel","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AItbvmkWTFsD_GLSqCjYzAd_9R0fEJs7iGYfFKB7fCc8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"The guys at sherwani king were great.
