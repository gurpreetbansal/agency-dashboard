I didn't have time to do this before coming back to GR so I took it to O'Neill. Turns out there was nothing wrong with my muffler! It would have been so easy to fix something that didn't need fixing because that's what I asked for but they were so honest and respectful and I'm so appreciative for that! So many other auto shops would have taken advantage of that opportunity. They also replaced my wheel bearing for a very affordable price and were so quick. Dropped it off the night before and they had it done by 11:30 AM the next day. I've had friends that had the same problem with their car and it took weeks for their auto shop to fix it and they were quoted SO much more. Definitely going back to them as long as I live in GR!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-04-21T02:49:29.476Z","update_time":"2021-04-21T02:49:29.476Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnWjrsWuHJQVrBYKyrGEQo5fLqwE9HVelk61-bOwcpUVjzsWH7JM2_OBSotoB9EGcAaMVWRag","reviewer_display_name":"Samantha S.","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjdmATq4HMfNUnwXodK7TgUzSTjHfSwHf9_G6F98w=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Have not had my service completed yet, but Doug was very professional and informative!

Ted was true to his word and quote and rebuilt the unit which required a lot more parts than normal.

They estimated they work they already done to be around $750 which is outrageous for work that I have not approved. I told them to put it back together how it was and push it out of the shop. Once I got my truck towed back to my house, I saw they just dumped the transmission off in the bed off my truck along with the fly wheel, clutch plate, front and rear drive shafts exhaust system and transfer case.

When I went to their shop to talk about the issues I was having, I was talked down to, and spoken to as if I knew nothing. Even when I started talking about my experience level, I was flat out told that I wouldn't be able to ever do these repairs on my own because rear axle assemblies \"have too many nuances\". They used big words and fear tactics to make the job seem way bigger than it was. Before leaving, they took my information and my vin number, told me they'd contact me back, and not only have I not heard from them in a week and a half to two weeks, but I've already had another shop do the work done while waiting to hear back.
