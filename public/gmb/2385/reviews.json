It\u2019s now the new focal point of our back yard. Mike and his crew were very professional, knowledgable, kind and always upfront throughout the entire process. There showroom was very nice for they don\u2019t just have small concrete samples but a large area so your able to really see the pattern and colors available to the fullest. Mike is very flexible to your schedule when planning on visiting the showroom. It only took a couple days to have everything installed once plans were finalized and scheduled. A couple weeks after we were able to place our hot tub on and really start to enjoy the new space.  Since it has been done we are constantly on it enjoying the hot tub and finishing the night around the fire pit. Specially now more than ever because the weather is warming up. We are able to enjoy ourselves surrounded by conversations, laughter and good times creating wonderful memories for our family and friends. It has actually brought our family together more because we are able to spend time gathered around outdoors rather than lives consumed with so many electronics. It has now been 1 winter and the concrete is still very strong with no chips and the color is as bright as the day it was installed. We added a non slip coating and in the rain it\u2019s not even the slightest bit of slippery. They made sure throughout the entire process they would express things that might be an issue later on and willing to work with you if you want to make small changes.
