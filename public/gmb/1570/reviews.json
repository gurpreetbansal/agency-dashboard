We had them come in to install a new bath and shower and it was a disaster. They completed the work in 1 day, but unfortunately I was not able to be at the house and be present. When we got home we got to see:\n-that they installed the wrong color tub.\n-damaged the walls and the cabinets in the bathroom (from carrying the tub and acrylic for the walls) and did not repair anything, let alone say anything about it or even leave a note.\n-did not put anything down on the stairs so they were filthy.\n-they cut everything for size in our living room instead of doing it outside and didn\u2019t clean anything up so it was littered with cut acrylic and dirt.\n-they installed the water pipe leading up to the shower head crooked so we got about 50% water pressure.\nWe explained this to the business owner, and he got ultra defensive about it with us. He had little sympathy and told us that if we wanted it fixed it would cost more money and it wouldn\u2019t be able to take place for at least 6 weeks due to them needing to work at one of the local universities. That that was their priority as they had a big dormitory project going on with them.\nThen the icing on the cake was when a few days later the first floor ceiling started leaking because the contractors that Klein\u2019s uses (oh, they say they have their own staff, but this is a lie as the business owner confirmed that they hire private contractors to do the work) didn\u2019t tighten the intake pipe properly resulting in a major leak that damaged the ceiling and cabinets in our kitchen. The contractor at least came out to fix the leak, but we were on the hook for the ceiling repair.\n\nGood luck if you hire these guys, you have been warned.","rating":"ONE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-03-12T22:33:45.306Z","update_time":"2019-03-12T22:33:45.306Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmZ69U6AYg2wAI4JES_F3KsrMpKH0QmkYj3fSqFpaiAgX0ILuID9fuwoNfcs0G3aox6RzCXrg","reviewer_display_name":"Pam Nolan","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GiJ66tga2OwdlS_Q3jflmtSTSRMPG3pVwGm59hIaZ8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Call Klein first!\n\nWe had work done by another company that used scare tactics to sell us a water management system that we didn't need and that didn't fix our original problem.
